Algebraic geometry
------------------

Let's consider a geometric entity (e.g. line, square), whose properties can
be described using a system of `m` polynomials:

.. math::

    \mathcal{H} = \{h_1, \ldots, h_m\}

We will call `\mathcal{H}` a hypothesis. Given a theorem concerning this
geometric entity, the algebraic formulation is as follows:

.. math::

    \forall_{x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n} (h_1 = 0 \vee \ldots \vee h_m = 0) \Rightarrow g = 0

where `g` is the conclusion of the theorem and `h_1, \ldots h_m` and `g`
are polynomials in `\mathrm{K}[x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n]`. It
follows from the |groebner| bases theory that the above statement is true
when `g` belongs to the ideal generated by `\mathcal{H}`. To check this,
i.e. to prove the theorem, it is sufficient to compute a |groebner| basis
of `\mathcal{H}` with respect to any admissible monomial ordering and
reduce `g` with respect to this basis. If the theorem is true then the
remainder from the reduction will vanish. In this example, for the sake
of simplicity, we assume that the geometric entity is non--degenerate,
i.e. it does not collapse into a line or a point.

Let's consider the following rhombus:

.. tikz:: A rhombus in a fixed coordinate system.
    :libs: calc, arrows, automata, backgrounds, decorations

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.0]
        \coordinate (A) at (0,0);
        \coordinate (B) at (4,0);
        \coordinate (D) at ($(A)!1!45:(B)$);
        \coordinate (C) at ($(D) + (4,0)$);

        \draw[solid] (A) -- (B) -- (C) -- (D) -- cycle;

        \draw[dashed] (A) -- (C);
        \draw[dashed] (B) -- (D);

        \coordinate (E) at (intersection of A--C and B--D) {};

        \node [below] at (A) {$A(0, 0)$};
        \node [below] at (B) {$B(x_B, 0)$};
        \node [above] at (C) {$C(x_C, y_C)$};
        \node [above] at (D) {$D(x_D, y_C)$};

        \fill[black] (A) circle (2pt);
        \fill[black] (B) circle (2pt);
        \fill[black] (C) circle (2pt);
        \fill[black] (D) circle (2pt);
        \fill[black] (E) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}

This geometric entity consists of four points `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`. To
setup a fixed coordinate system, without loss of generality, we can assume
that `A = (0, 0)`, `B = (x_B, 0)`, `C = (x_C, y_C)` and `D = (x_D, y_D)`.
This is possible by taking rotational invariance of the geometric entity.
We will prove that the diagonals of this rhombus, i.e. `AD` and `BC` are
mutually perpendicular. We have the following conditions describing `ABCD`:

#. Line `AD` is parallel to `BC`, i.e. `AD \parallel BC`.
#. Sides of `ABCD` are of the equal length, i.e. `AB = BC`.
#. The rhombus is non--degenerate, i.e. is not a line or a point.

Our conclusion is that `AC \bot BD`. To prove this theorem, first we need to
transform the above conditions and the conclusion into a set of polynomials.
How we can achieve this? Let's focus on the first condition. In general, we
are given two lines `A_1A_2` and `B_1B_2`. To express the relation between
those two lines, i.e. that `A_1A_2` is parallel `B_1B_2`, we can relate
slopes of those lines:

.. math::

    \frac{y_{A_2} - y_{A_1}}{x_{A_2} - x_{A_1}} = \frac{y_{B_2} - y_{B_1}}{x_{B_2} - x_{B_1}}

Clearing denominators in the above expression and putting all terms on the
left hand side of the equation, we derive a general polynomial describing the
first condition. This can be literally translated into Python::

    >>> def parallel(A1, A2, B1, B2):
    ...    """Line [A1, A2] is parallel to line [B1, B2]. """
    ...    return (A2.y - A1.y)*(B2.x - B1.x) - (B2.y - B1.y)*(A2.x - A1.x)
    ...

assuming that ``A1``, ``A2``, ``B1`` and ``B2`` are instances of :class:`Point`
class. In the case of our rhombus, we will take advantage of the fixed coordinate
system and simplify the resulting polynomials as much as possible. The same
approach can be used to derive polynomial representation of the other conditions
and the conclusion. To construct `\mathcal{H}` and `g` we will use the following
functions::

    >>> def distance(A1, A2):
    ...    """The squared distance between points A1 and A2. """
    ...    return (A2.x - A1.x)**2 + (A2.y - A1.y)**2
    ...

    >>> def equal(A1, A2, B1, B2):
    ...    """Lines [A1, A2] and [B1, B2] are of the same width. """
    ...    return distance(A1, A2) - distance(B1, B2)
    ...

    >>> def perpendicular(A1, A2, B1, B2):
    ...    """Line [A1, A2] is perpendicular to line [B1, B2]. """
    ...    return (A2.x - A1.x)*(B2.x - B1.x) + (A2.y - A1.y)*(B2.y - B1.y)
    ...

The non--degeneracy statement requires a few words of comment. Many theorems
in geometry are true only in the non--degenerative case and false or undefined
otherwise. In our approach to theorem proving in algebraic geometry, we must
supply sufficient non--degeneracy conditions manually. In the case of our
rhombus this is `x_B > 0` and `y_C > 0` (we don't need to take `x_C` into
account because `AB = BC`). At first, this seems to be a show stopper, as
|groebner| bases don't support inequalities. However, we can use Rabinovich's
trick and transform those inequalities into a single polynomial condition by
introducing an additional variable, e.g. `a`, about which we will assume that
is positive. This gives us a non--degeneracy condition `x_B y_C - a`.

With all this knowledge we are ready to prove the main theorem. First, let's
declare variables::

    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> init_printing(use_unicode=True, no_global=True)

    >>> var('x_B, x_C, y_C, x_D, a')
    (x_B, x_C, y_C, x_D, a)

    >>> V = _[:-1]

We declared the additional variable `a`, but we don't consider it a variable
of our problem. Let's now define the four points `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`::

    >>> A = Point(0, 0)
    >>> B = Point(x_B, 0)
    >>> C = Point(x_C, y_C)
    >>> D = Point(x_D, y_C)

Using the previously defined functions we can formulate the hypothesis::

    >>> h1 = parallel(A, D, B, C)
    >>> h2 = equal(A, B, B, C)
    >>> h3 = x_B*y_C - a

and compute its |groebner| basis::

    >>> G = groebner([h1, h2, h3], *V, order='grlex')

We had to specify the variables of the problem explicitly in
:func:`groebner`, because otherwise it would treat `a` also as a
variable, which we don't want. Now we can verify the theorem::

    >>> reduced(perpendicular(A, C, B, D), G, *V, order='grlex')[1]
    0

The remainder vanished, which proves that `AC \bot BD`. Although, the theorem
we described and proved here is a simple one, one can handle much more advanced
problems as well using |groebner| bases techniques. One should refer to Franz
Winkler's papers for more advanced examples.
