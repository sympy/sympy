# Solve Equations

The Python package SymPy can symbolically solve equations, differential equations,
linear equations, nonlinear equations, matrix problems, inequalities,
Diophantine equations, and evaluate integrals. SymPy can also solve numerically.

The [solving guide](solving-guidance.md) provides suggestions for many
types of solving tasks.

Note: SymPy has a function called {func}`~.solve`
which is designed to find the roots of an equation or system of equations.
SymPy {func}`~.solve` may or may not be what you need for a particular problem,
so we recommend you use the links on this page to learn how to "solve" your problem.
And while a common, colloquial expression is, for example, ["solve an integral"](../../modules/integrals/integrals.rst),
in SymPy's terminology it would be ["evaluate an integral."](../../modules/integrals/integrals.rst)
