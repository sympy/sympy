# Solve a nonlinear equation system numerically

Use SymPy to numerically solve a system of one or more equations. For example, numerically solving $\cos(x) = x $ returns $ x \approx 0.739085133215161$.

Alternatives to consider:
- *alternative 1*
- *alternative 2*

Here is a simple example of *title*:

```py
>>> code
result
```

nsolve *link* is based on [mpmath.findroot](https://mpmath.org/doc/current/calculus/optimization.html#root-finding-findroot), and can pass parameters to it.
