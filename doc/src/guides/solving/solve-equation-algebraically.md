# Solve an Equation Algebraically

Use SymPy to solve an equation algebraically (symbolically). For example,
solving $x^2 = y$ for $x$ yields $x \in \{-\sqrt{y},\sqrt{y}\}$.

## Alternatives to consider
- SymPy can also [solve many other types of problems including sets of
equations](index.md).
- Some equations cannot be solved algebraically (either at all or by SymPy), so
you may have to {func}`solve your equation numerically
<sympy.solvers.solvers.nsolve>` instead.

## Solving Functions
There are two high-level functions to solve equations, {func}`~.solve` and
{func}`~.solveset`. Here is an example of each:

{func}`~.solve`

```py
>>> from sympy.abc import x, y
>>> from sympy import solve
>>> solve(x**2 - y, x, dict=True)
[{x: -sqrt(y)}, {x: sqrt(y)}]
```

{func}`~.solveset`

```py
>>> from sympy import solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x, y
>>> solveset(x**2 - y, x)
{-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}
```

Here are recommendations on when to use:

- {func}`~.solve`
    - You want to get explicit symbolic representations of the different values
    a variable could take that would satisfy the equation.
    - You want to substitute those explicit solution values into other equations
    or expressions involving the same variable using
    {meth}`~sympy.core.basic.Basic.subs`

- {func}`~.solveset`
    - You want to represent the solutions in a mathematically precise way, using
    [mathematical sets](../../modules/sets.rst).
    - You want a representation of all the solutions, including if there are
    infinitely many.
    - You want a consistent input interface.
    - You want to limit the domain of the solutions to any arbitrary set.
    - You do not need to programmatically extract solutions from the solution
    set: solution sets cannot necessarily be interrogated programmatically.

## Solve an Equation Algebraically

You can solve an equation in several ways. The examples below demonstrate using
both {func}`~.solve` and {func}`~.solveset` where applicable. You can choose the
function best suited to your equation.

### Make Your Equation Into an Expression That Equals Zero

Use the fact that any expression not in an `Eq` (equation) is automatically
assumed to equal zero (0) by the solving functions. You can rearrange the
equation $x^2 = y$ to $x^2 - y = 0$, and solve that expression. This approach is
convenient if you are interactively solving an expression which already equals
zero, or an equation that you do not mind rearranging to $expression = 0$.

```py
>>> from sympy import solve, solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x, y
>>> solve(x**2 - y, x, dict=True)
[{x: -sqrt(y)}, {x: sqrt(y)}]
>>> solveset(x**2 - y, x)
{-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}
```

### Put Your Equation Into `Eq` Form

Put your equation into `Eq` form, then solve the `Eq`. This approach is
convenient if you are interactively solving an equation which you already have
in the form of an equation, or which you think of as an equality. It also helps
to prevent sign errors when subtracting one side from the other.

```py
>>> from sympy import Eq, solve, solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x, y
>>> eqn = Eq(x**2, y)
>>> eqn
Eq(x**2, y)
>>> solutions = solve(eqn, x, dict=True)
>>> print(solutions)
[{x: -sqrt(y)}, {x: sqrt(y)}]
>>> solutions_set = solveset(eqn, x)
>>> print(solutions_set)
{-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}
>>> for solution_set in solutions_set:
...     print(solution_set)
sqrt(y)
-sqrt(y)
```

### Restrict the Domain of Solutions

By default, SymPy will return solutions in the complex domain, which also
includes purely real and imaginary values. Here, the first two solutions are
real, and the last two are imaginary:

```py
>>> from sympy import Symbol, solve, solveset
>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> solve(x**4 - 256, x, dict=True)
[{x: -4}, {x: 4}, {x: -4*I}, {x: 4*I}]
>>> solveset(x**4 - 256, x)
{-4, 4, -4*I, 4*I}
```

To restrict returned solutions to real numbers, or another domain or range, the
different solving functions use different methods.

For {func}`~.solve`, place an assumption on the symbol to be solved for, $x$

```py
>>> from sympy import Symbol, solve
>>> x = Symbol('x', real=True)
>>> solve(x**4 - 256, x, dict=True)
[{x: -4}, {x: 4}]
```

or restrict the solutions with standard Python techniques for filtering a list
such as a list comprehension:

```py
>>> from sympy import Or, Symbol, solve
>>> x = Symbol('x', real=True)
>>> expr = (x-4)*(x-3)*(x-2)*(x-1)
>>> solution = solve(expr, x)
>>> print(solution)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> solution_outside_2_3 = [v for v in solution if (v.is_real and Or(v<2,v>3))]
>>> print(solution_outside_2_3)
[1, 4]
```

For {func}`~.solveset`, limit the output domain in the function call by setting
a domain

```py
>>> from sympy import S, solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> solveset(x**4 - 256, x, domain=S.Reals)
{-4, 4}
```

or by restricting returned solutions to any arbitrary set, including an
interval:

```py
>>> from sympy import Interval, pi, sin, solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> solveset(sin(x), x, Interval(-pi, pi))
{0, -pi, pi}
```

and if you restrict the solutions to a domain in which there are no solutions,
{func}`~.solveset` will return the empty set,
[EmptySet](../../modules/sets.rst):

```py
>>> from sympy import solveset, S
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> solveset(x**2 + 1, x, domain=S.Reals)
EmptySet
```

### Explicitly Represent Infinite Sets of Possible Solutions

{func}`~.solveset` [can represent infinite sets of possible
solutions](why-solveset) and express them in standard mathematical notation, for
example $\sin(x) = 0$ for $x = n * \pi$ for every integer value of $n$:

```py
>>> from sympy import pprint, sin, solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> solution = solveset(sin(x), x)
>>> pprint(solution)
{2*n*pi | n in Integers} U {2*n*pi + pi | n in Integers}
```

However, {func}`~.solve` will return only a finite number of solutions:

```py
>>> from sympy import sin, solve
>>> from sympy.calculus.util import periodicity
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> f = sin(x)
>>> solve(f, x)
[0, pi]
>>> periodicity(f, x)
2*pi
```

{func}`~.solve` tries to return just enough solutions so that all (infinitely
many) solutions can generated from the returned solutions by adding integer
multiples of the {func}`~.periodicity` of the equation, here $2\pi$.

## Use the Solution Result

### Substitute Solutions From {func}`~.solve` Into an Expression

You can substitute solutions from {func}`~.solve` into an expression.

A common use case is finding the critical points and values for a function $f$.
At the critical points, the {class}`~.Derivative` equals zero (or is undefined).
You can then obtain the function values at those critical points by substituting
the critical points back into the function using
{meth}`~sympy.core.basic.Basic.subs`. You can also tell if the critical point is
a maxima or minima by substituting the values into the expression for the second
derivative: a negative value indicates a maximum, and a positive value indicates
a minimum.

```py
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> from sympy import solve, diff
>>> f = x**3 + x**2 - x
>>> derivative = diff(f, x)
>>> critical_points = solve(derivative, x, dict=True)
>>> print(critical_points)
[{x: -1}, {x: 1/3}]
>>> point1, point2 = critical_points
>>> print(f.subs(point1))
1
>>> print(f.subs(point2))
-5/27
>>> curvature = diff(f, x, 2)
>>> print(curvature.subs(point1))
-4
>>> print(curvature.subs(point2))
4
```

### {func}`~.solveset` Solution Sets Cannot Necessarily Be Interrogated Programmatically

If {func}`~.solveset` returns a finite set (class {class}`~.FiniteSet`), you can
iterate through the solutions:

```py
>>> from sympy import solveset
>>> from sympy.abc import x, y
>>> solution_set = solveset(x**2 - y, x)
>>> print(solution_set)
{-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}
>>> solution_list = list(solution_set)
>>> print(solution_list)
[sqrt(y), -sqrt(y)]
```

However, for more complex results, it may not be possible to list the solutions:

```py
>>> from sympy import S, solveset, symbols
>>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
>>> solution_set = solveset(x**2 - y, x, domain=S.Reals)
>>> print(solution_set)
Intersection({-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}, Reals)
>>> list(solution_set)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: The computation had not completed because of the undecidable set
membership is found in every candidates.
```

In this case, it is because, if $y$ is negative, its square root would be
imaginary rather than real and therefore outside the declared domain of the
solution set. By declaring $y$ to be real and positive, SymPy can determine that
its square root is real, and thus resolve the intersection between the solutions
and the set of real numbers:

```py
>>> from sympy import S, Symbol, solveset
>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> y = Symbol('y', real=True, positive=True)
>>> solution_set = solveset(x**2 - y, x, domain=S.Reals)
>>> print(solution_set)
{-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}
>>> list(solution_set)
[sqrt(y), -sqrt(y)]
```

Alternatively, you can extract the sets from the solution set using {any}`args
<sympy.core.basic.Basic.args>`, then create a list from the set containing the
symbolic solutions:

```py
>>> from sympy import S, solveset, symbols
>>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
>>> solution_set = solveset(x**2 - y, x, domain=S.Reals)
>>> print(solution_set)
Intersection({-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)}, Reals)
>>> solution_set_args = solution_set.args
>>> print(solution_set.args)
(Reals, {-sqrt(y), sqrt(y)})
>>> list(solution_set_args[1])
[sqrt(y), -sqrt(y)]
```

## Options That Can Speed up {func}`~.solve`

Refer to [solving guidance](solving-guidance.md#options-that-can-speed-up).

## Not All Equations Can Be Solved

### Equations With No Closed-Form Solution

Some equations have no closed-form solution, in which case SymPy may return an
empty set or give an error. For example, the following [transcendental
equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_equation) has no
closed-form solution:

```py
>>> from sympy import cos, solve
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> solve(cos(x) - x, x, dict=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
NotImplementedError: multiple generators [x, cos(x)]
No algorithms are implemented to solve equation -x + cos(x)
```

### Equations Which Have a Closed-Form Solution, and SymPy Cannot Solve

It is also possible that there is an algebraic solution to your equation, and
SymPy has not implemented an appropriate algorithm. If that happens, or SymPy
returns an empty set or list when there is a mathematical solution (indicating a
bug in SymPy), please post it on the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/g/sympy), or open an issue on [SymPy's GitHub
page](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues). Until the issue is resolved, you
can {func}`solve your equation numerically <sympy.solvers.solvers.nsolve>`
instead.

## Report a Bug

If you find a bug with a solving function, please post the problem on the
[SymPy mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/sympy). Until the issue is resolved,
you can use a different method listed in [](#alternatives-to-consider).
