SymPy Logo

We would like to make it easy for you to include the SymPy project identity in
your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation.

You can find this high-resolution version of the SymPy logo
`here <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/doc/src/logo/sympy.svg>`_.

If you would like to generate SymPy's collection of official logos yourself,
you can do so by running:

.. code-block:: none

    $ cd doc

    $ make logo # will be stored in the _build/logo subdirectory

which will generate the logos by using the ``sympy.svg`` file in your local
copy of SymPy.

There is also a ``sympy/doc/generate_logos.py`` script that allows for a wider
variety of options while generating the logo.

The license of all the logos is the same as SymPy: BSD. See the
`LICENSE file <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ for more information.
