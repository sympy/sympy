# Press Kit

We would like to make it easy for you to include the SymPy project identity in
your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation.

You will find a high-resolution version of the SymPy logo
[here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/doc/src/logo/sympy.svg). Note
that the logo is subject to the BSD license, just like SymPy itself. See the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/LICENSE) file for more
information.

If you would like to generate the SymPy logo yourself, you can see the
instructions for how to do that [here](sympy-logo).

If you would like to generate SymPy's collection of official logos yourself,
you can do so by running:

.. code-block:: none

    $ cd doc

    $ make logo # will be stored in the _build/logo subdirectory

which will generate the logos by using the ``sympy.svg`` file in your local
copy of SymPy.

There is also a ``sympy/doc/generate_logos.py`` script that allows for a wider
variety of options while generating the logo.

The license of all the logos is the same as SymPy: BSD. See the
`LICENSE file <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ for more information.
