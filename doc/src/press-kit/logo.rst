# Press Kit

We would like to make it easy for you to include the SymPy project identity in
your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation.

You will find a high-resolution version of the SymPy logo
[here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/doc/src/logo/sympy.svg). Note
that the logo is subject to the BSD license, just like SymPy itself. See the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/LICENSE) file for more
information.

If you would like to generate the SymPy logo yourself, you can see the
instructions for how to do that [here](sympy-logo).
