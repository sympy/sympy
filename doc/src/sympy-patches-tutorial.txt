For impatient
=============

If you just want to create a couple of patches in 5 minutes and be done with
it, follow the `Quick Start`_ in the Appendix. However, if you want to make your
work more effective and also learn how we work, read this whole tutorial.

Introduction
============

In SymPy_ we encourage collaborative work.

Everyone is welcome to join and to implement new feature, fix some bug, give
general advice, etc... Also, we try to discuss everything and to review each
other's work so that many eyes can see more thus raising the quality.

General discussion takes place on `sympy@googlecode.com`_ mailing list and in
the issues_, and the code is discussed in `sympy-patches@googlecode.com`_
mailing list.

As someone of you already know, software development is not just coding. A lot
of non-coding tasks have to be done in order to produce *good* code. Just to
mention a few: setting up infrastructure, designing, testing, documenting,
assisting new developers (we are doing it here), and of course programming.

But even programming is not all about writing the code, it is about writing the
code *and* preparing it so that the code can be included into the project.

Both producing the code and bringing it to the project are important parts of
the game -- without the code there is nothing to bring in, and having the code
outside is a nowin for anyone.

As already said above, we review changes. This idea was borrowed from
successful projects like Linux, Python, SAGE and a lot more. In short each
change is first reviewed by other developers and only when it is approved the
code is pushed in.

Like it takes effort to write good and clear code, reviewing other's work needs
effort too. There are good practices how to do things so that reviewing is fun
for both the author and the reviewer. We try to follow them, and we'll try to
show you how to follow too.

This tutorial will guide you how to do SymPy development with Mercurial and
patches.

    when reviewing other's patches you *learn* a lot, so why not to join as a
    reviewer too?

Workflow
========

Here we'll describe the workflow using real world example where we fix some bug.


Hacking
-------

Suppose I want to fix issue `#755`

.. image:: pics/1b.png

I go there

.. image:: pics/2.png

Look at the problem description

.. image:: pics/3b.png

...

.. image:: pics/4b.png


Aah, it looks like printing code in `sympy/printing/printer.py` tries to treat
`expr` as an instance of a new-style class. I think I know how to fix this!

.. image:: pics/5b.png


Ok, going to dive into the problem.

First of all there exist two approaches to work:

1. doing all the work in one repository, and
2. creating new repository for each task

In practice both of them have pros and cons, but we'll consider the second one
as it does the job and is simpler.

So, let's clone main repo, and go hacking

.. admonition:: By the way

    if you haven't already done so, do

    .. parsed-literal::

        $ :input:`hg clone http://hg.sympy.org/sympy`

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg clone sympy sympy-fix755`
    updating working directory
    386 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
    $ :input:`cd sympy-fix755`

.. note::

    This is a real-life example. If you want to repeat the exact steps, update
    your working directory to 4962f6641827 revision now:

    .. parsed-literal::

        $ :input:`hg up 4962f6641827`

.. note::

    We now recommend to use git. This tutorial was written when we still used
    mercurial. See our `Quick Start`_ for an introduction to git and use our
    `Git hg rosetta stone <http://wiki.sympy.org/wiki/Git_hg_rosetta_stone>`_
    wiki page to learn how to translate commands between mercurial and git. The
    ideas in this tutorial stay correct, the exact commands can be a little
    different with git though.

I use vim_ editor, and usually it is very handy to navigate by tags, so I build
tags database first, then invoke my editor [2]_

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`ctags -R`
    $ :input:`vim`

It was in `_print` function, so I locate it using tags

.. image:: pics/6.png

here it is

.. image:: pics/7.png

and here is the failing code

.. image:: pics/8.png


Aah, it seems old classes do not have the attribute `__class__`. Let's see if
this is the gist of the problem.

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`./bin/isympy`

    In [1]: :input:`class C: pass`
       ...:

    In [2]: :input:`C`
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    exceptions.AttributeError                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...

    AttributeError: class C has no attribute '__class__'



Yes, it is. So I change it to what would always work. Then I invoke `hq` [3]_
to see what I've changed:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hq`

.. image:: pics/9.png

and its time to see whether this fixes the problem

.. parsed-literal::

    In [1]: :input:`import sympy`
    In [2]: :input:`sympy.__dict__`

oops, another bug seems to be sitting there:

.. image:: pics/10.png

after some examination it turned out to be a problem related to pretty-printing
of sequences with even height

.. parsed-literal::

    In [3] :input:`{x**2: 1}`
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    exceptions.ValueError                     Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...

    ValueError: xobj: expect length = 2*k+1

I decided to add another row for this case

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hqq`      # `full diff at this stage`_

.. _full diff at this stage: spt-patches/1.patch


.. image:: pics/11.png

since after all it looks good:

.. parsed-literal::

    In [1]: :input:`[x**2]`
    Out[1]:
    ⎡ 2⎤
    ⎣x ⎦

    In [2]: :input:`(x**2,)`
    Out[2]:
    ⎛ 2⎞
    ⎝x ⎠

    In [3]: :input:`{x**2: 1}`
    Out[3]:
    ⎧ 2   ⎫
    ⎨x : 1⎬
    ⎩     ⎭

so why not?

Now let's verify that printing tests pass

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`py.test sympy/printing/`
    ============================= test process starts ==============================
    executable:   /usr/bin/python2.5  (2.5.0-final-0)
    using py lib: /home/kirr/src/tools/py/py-0.9.0/py <rev unknown>

    sympy/printing/tests/test_python.py[6] ......

    ============== tests finished: 37 passed, 4 xfail in 0.30 seconds =============

Everything seems to be ok with pprinting evenly heighted sequences. Let's
get back to original problem:

.. parsed-literal::

    In [1]: :input:`class C: pass`
       ...:

    In [2]: :input:`C`
    Out[2]: __main__.C

    In [3]: :input:`import sympy`
    In [4]: :input:`sympy.__dict__`
    (a lot is printed)

ok, it works.

Let's write tests (this is important)


.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hqq`      # 2.patch_


.. image:: pics/12.png

.. _2.patch: spt-patches/2.patch


Also, when looking at `_print` function again, I've noticed there are typos in
`printer.py` so I've spellchecked the whole file

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hqq`      # 3.patch_

.. image:: pics/13.png

.. _3.patch: spt-patches/3.patch

It seems we have done the job now.

To ensure everything stays in shape, let's see if all tests pass

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`./setup.py test`
    running test
    ============================= test process starts ==============================
    executable:   /usr/bin/python2.5  (2.5.0-final-0)

Good.

Back to version control
-----------------------

We've finished hacking, and it's time to remember about version control. The
goal is to prepare our work for inclusion into the project.

First, there are three semantically independent changes made:

1. `_print` dispatcher was fixed to handle old-style classes correctly
2. we fixed pretty-printing to handle vertical objects of even height
3. typos in `sympy/printing/printer.py` were fixed

It is good to structure changes, and as said in the Introduction_ we try to
make the whole process fun for all, so let's prepare three separate patches for
each change. This way it would be easier to review them.

For this we are going to use `Mercurial Queues`_ and `Record`_ extensions.

.. admonition:: By the way

    if you haven't already done so, include the following lines into your `~/.hgrc`::

        [extensions]
        hgext.mq        =
        hgext.record    =


I'm going to record fix for `#755` first

.. note::

    The command `qrecord` below was introduced in Mercurial 1.0. If you have an
    older version of Mercurial, consider upgrading it. If that is not possible,
    you can use `hg qnew -f` and `hg qrefresh` commands -- they'll do the job,
    although they are not-so-convenient when you work on several things
    at once (that's why `qrecord` was invented).

Pay attention to how I carefully choose which hunks go into this patch and
which do not. Especially note how **some** changes made to `printer.py` were
recorded and other changes (spelling fixes) were left intact in the work dir.

Then an editor is popped up and asks about commit message:

Patches are ready, lets send them for review
--------------------------------------------

At this stage we are done with preparing our patches, and it is time to send
them for review.

First, let's rebase them to the latest tip.

For this we go to `sympy` mirroring repository, see whats new, and pull updates:

    searching for changes
    adding changesets
    adding manifests
    adding file changes
    added 5 changesets with 26 changes to 21 files
    21 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved

Now let's get back to `sympy-fix755`

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`cd ../sympy-fix755/`

We have three patches applied

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg qapplied`
    pprint-fix-old-classes.patch_
    xobj-fix-even-height.patch_
    printer-fix-typos.patch_

Let's rebase them.

First we *unapply* all patches

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg qpop -a`
    Patch queue now empty

Then pull recent changes in from our mirror repo

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg pull -u`
    pulling from /home/kirr/src/sympy/spt-work/sympy
    searching for changes
    adding changesets
    adding manifests
    adding file changes
    added 5 changesets with 26 changes to 21 files
    21 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved

Then apply patches back

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg qpush --all`
    applying pprint-fix-old-classes.patch
    applying xobj-fix-even-height.patch
    applying printer-fix-typos.patch
    Now at: printer-fix-typos.patch


Now we have our patches applied on top of the latest tip.

.. note::

    We were lucky.

    Sometimes changes we've made *overlap* with the changes made by other
    developers. This situation is called conflict_ and has to be resolved using
    automated merge programs or by hands.

    This topic is out of scope of this tutorial, but an interested reader is
    encouraged to read `chapter 3`_ in hgbook_ and TutorialConflict_ HG wiki
    page.

Ok, it time to send patches for review!

Ensure last time on outgoing changes

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg out`
    comparing with /home/kirr/src/sympy/spt-work/sympy
    searching for changes

And let's finally send them:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg email --outgoing`

    Sending [PATCH 3 of 3] printer.py: fix typos ...


Ok, patches sent.

Usually I use Mutt_, but I'm having temporary problems with mail delivery
today, so this is sympy-patches as viewed from Google web interface:

.. image:: pics/19.png


Ondrej already reviewed them, and all patches were approved. Good.

Two possibilities exist here:

1. patches may be applied by reviewer, and
2. patches may be pushed in by the author

Generally when you just begin contributing to SymPy, your patches will be
applied by someone else, but as your experience matures, you'll be granted
priviledges to push in yourself.


Anyway, let's see how pushing is done:

Let's first push to local `sympy` mirror

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`hg push --force`
    pushing to /home/kirr/src/sympy/spt-work/sympy
    searching for changes
    adding changesets
    adding manifests
    adding file changes
    added 3 changesets with 5 changes to 4 files

.. note::

    ``--force`` is used here because otherwise ``hg push`` complains that
    ``source has mq patches applied``. As we still push to local repository we
    know what we do.

.. note::

    If you want to convert MQ patches to regular commits in the same
    repository, use "``hg qdelete -r qbase:qtip``" (the patches need to be
    applied).

Now let's go to `sympy` mirror and push into main repo!

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`cd ../sympy`
    $ :input:`hg push ssh://hg@hg.sympy.org/sympy`
    pushing to ssh://hg@hg.sympy.org/sympy
    searching for changes
    remote: adding changesets
    remote: adding manifests
    remote: adding file changes
    remote: added 3 changesets with 5 changes to 4 files
    remote: notify: sending 1 subscribers 1 changes
    remote: notify: sending 1 subscribers 1 changes
    remote: notify: sending 1 subscribers 1 changes


Ok, patches are pushed. Here is what `http://hg.sympy.org/sympy/` says:

.. image:: pics/17.png

Now, let's close `#755`

.. image:: pics/18.png

And we are done!

Epilogue
--------

Let's summarize the approach:

1. First relax, and hack on the problem as you see fit
2. When you think you've reached the point when something is done, start
   recording patches
3. After your patches are prepared, send them for review
4. If everything is ok, patches go to the main repository.

Interested readers are suggested to read additional literature:

1. `Mercurial Book`_, and
2. its chapters about mercurial queues: (I_, II_)
3. Mercurial wiki pages: Tutorial_, `Mq Tutorial`_, `Mercurial Queues`_,

.. _I:  `hgbook on MQ part1`_
.. _II: `hgbook on MQ part2`_


And of course

.. admonition:: *Patches Welcome!*

    We've reached the end of this tutorial, now it's time to practice on the
    SymPy_ project: http://www.sympy.org/

    We encourage you to join us. Feel free to improve SymPy_ and this tutorial
    as well.

    .. rubric:: *Have Fun!*

    | *See You, and*
    | *Patches Welcome!*

How to Write Docstrings
=======================

Execute the code that you want to add into the docstrings by::

    $ bin/isympy -c python -p no
    [...]
    Documentation can be found at http://sympy.org/

    >>> x = Symbol("x", positive=True)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> x.assumptions0   # doctest: +SKIP
    {'commutative': True, 'complex': True, 'imaginary': False, 'negative':
    False, 'nonnegative': True, 'nonpositive': False, 'nonzero': True,
    'positive': True, 'real': True, 'zero': False}
    >>>

This is important, because doctests use ``sstrrepr`` printer, which orders
dictionaries in a hash *independent* way, and so does ``bin/isympy -c
python -p no``, so you can just copy & paste the output from there into
the docstring. Then check the docstring with (assuming you changed
``basic.py``)::

    $ bin/doctest sympy/core/basic.py
    ============================= test process starts ==============================
    executable:   /usr/bin/python  (2.6.2-final-0)

    sympy/core/basic.py[30] ..............................                      [OK]

    ================== tests finished: 30 passed in 0.14 seconds ===================


and that's it.


Appendix
========

.. _Quick Start:

Quick Start
-----------

This section explains how to get you up and running in 5 minutes. However we
recommend that you read the full tutorial above, at least the introduction and
then go briefly through the rest.

You can use both git and mercurial with SymPy. Originally we only used
mercurial, but later several core developers switched to git. Use what you
prefer, but git is recommended.

**Quick Start with Git**

Edit your ``~/.gitconfig`` (tell git your name and setup colors and some handy
shortcuts)::

    [user]
        name = Ondrej Certik
        email = ondrej@certik.cz

    [color]
        diff  = auto
        status= auto
        branch= auto
        interactive = true

    [alias]
        ci = commit
        di = diff --color-words
        st = status
        co = checkout

    [sendemail]
        to = sympy-patches@googlegroups.com

Download the latest SymPy git and fix something:

.. parsed-literal::

    Resolving deltas: 100% (11260/11260), done.
    $ :input:`cd sympy`
    $ :input:`vim sympy/matrices/matrices.py`

Check your changes:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`git di`
    diff --git a/sympy/matrices/matrices.py b/sympy/matrices/matrices.py
    index 02b01cc..ae36b31 100644

    -    C = property(conjugate,None,None,"By-element conjugation.")
    +    C = property(conjugate, None, None, "By-element conjugation.")

         @property
         def H(self):

Commit them:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`git ci -a -m "Matrices: white space corrected"`
    Created commit 5b6bf9c: Matrices: white space corrected
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

Do more changes, commit, etc.:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`vim sympy/matrices/matrices.py`
    $ :input:`git ci -a -m "Matrices: more white space corrected"`
    Created commit 1b8615d: Matrices: more white space corrected
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

Generate the final patches:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`git format-patch -n -2`
    0001-Matrices-white-space-corrected.patch
    0002-Matrices-more-white-space-corrected.patch

The "-n" means to create a patch series with subjects like [1/2], [2/2] and
"-2" tells git to generate patches from the latest two commits. Check the
generated files that all is ok and then either attach them to our issues_, or
send it to our list, preferably to the `sympy-patches@googlecode.com`_ list.

Tip: to send the patch to the sympy-patches list conveniently from the command
line, do:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :input:`git send-email 000*`
    0001-Matrices-white-space-corrected.patch

<http://wiki.sympy.org/wiki/Git_hg_rosetta_stone>`_ wiki page and
follow links from there.

**Quick Start with Mercurial**

Edit your ``~/.hgrc`` (tell Mercurial your name and use git style diffs)::

.. 1: When working on something, let's use MQ from the beginning.
.. Split the change into logical chunks and let them live in their own patches.
.. 2: when working on patches, qrefresh them as many times as you see fit.
.. 3: In the end of the day, use qcommit to save your work in MQ, and allow others to clone your patches, and contribute to patches through usual pull/push/whatever
.. 4: When patches are 'done' (i.e. reviewed, enhanced, etc) -- include them into the trunk, and qdel from MQ
