=============================================
Policy on AI Generated Code and Communication
=============================================

"AI" herein refers to tools like large language models (LLMs) that can
generate, edit, and review software code or generate human-like communication.

You are responsible for any code you submit to SymPy's repositories, regardless
of whether it was manually written or generated by AI. You must understand and
explain the code you submit as well as the existing related code. It is not
acceptable to submit a patch that you cannot understand and explain yourself.
In explaining your contribution, do not use AI to automatically generate
descriptions, as AI rarely communicates such information correctly and
concisely.

If you substantially make use of large language models (or similar) to assist
in the development of your patch, you must disclose how it was used and what
code in the patch is AI generated. We will reject any pull request that does
not include the disclosure.

Code generated from AI is very often of low quality. Contributors are expected
to submit code that meets SymPy's standards in the same manner as was expected
before AI tools existed. We will reject pull requests that we deem being "`AI
slop`_". Do not waste developers' time by submitting code that is fully or
mostly generated by AI.

All code in SymPy is released under the BSD 3-clause copyright license.
Contributors to SymPy license their code under the same license when it is
included into SymPy's version control repository. That means contributors must
own the copyright of any code submitted to SymPy or must include the BSD
3-clause compatible open source license(s) associated with the submitted code
in the patch. Code generated from AI may infringe on copyright and it is the
submitter's responsibility to not infringe. We will reject any pull requests,
AI generated or not, where the copyright is in question.

When interacting in communication among developers (email list, discussions,
issues, pull requests, etc.) do not use AI to speak for you, other than for
translation or grammar editing. If the developers want to chat with a chatbot,
they can do so themselves. Human-to-human communication is essential for an
open source community to thrive.

A high quality patch to SymPy that follows our development practices and
includes human communication to get it merged may be assisted by AI, but in our
experience, this requires a seasoned developer to properly execute. If you are
a new contributor to SymPy, we will most likely close any issues, discussions,
or pull requests that are substantially generated from AI. New contributors
that are applicants to programs such as Google Summer of Code that do not abide
by this AI policy and/or that use AI to produce their application will be
disqualified from the application process.
