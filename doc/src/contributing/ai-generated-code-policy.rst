==========================================
AI Generated Code and Communication Policy
==========================================

"AI" herein refers to generative AI tools like large language models (LLMs)
that can generate, edit, and review software code, create and manipulate
images, or generate human-like communication.
The :ref:`autonomous-agents` section below governs a separate case: software
that submits contributions independently, without a human reviewing each
action first.

Responsibility
==============

You are responsible for any code you submit to SymPy's repositories, regardless
of whether it was manually written or generated by AI. You must understand and
explain the code you submit as well as the existing related code. It is not
acceptable to submit a patch that you cannot understand and explain yourself.
In explaining your contribution, do not use AI to automatically generate
descriptions, as AI rarely communicates such information correctly and
concisely.

Disclosure
==========

If you substantially make use of AI to assist in the development of your patch,
you must disclose how it was used and what code in the patch is AI generated.
We will reject any pull request that does not include the disclosure.

Autonomous Agents
=================

An autonomous agent is a bot or automated system that opens pull requests,
files issues, or posts comments on its own, without a human checking and
approving each action first. This is different from tools like GitHub Copilot
or Cursor, where a human writes, reviews, and submits the code — those are
covered by the Responsibility and Disclosure sections above.

Autonomous agents are not permitted to submit pull requests, open issues, or
post comments to SymPy's repositories, with the exception below.

Exception for maintainer-operated bots
---------------------------------------

Automated processes run by SymPy maintainers are permitted. This includes
release tooling, changelog generation, and CI comment bots.
Such automation must be:

- run or explicitly approved by a SymPy maintainer,
- clearly identified as a bot in its GitHub profile or commit messages, and
- doing a fixed, well-defined task rather than generating new contributions.

If you are not sure whether your bot qualifies, ask the maintainers before
running it.

If a pull request is found to have been submitted by an unauthorised agent,
it will be closed immediately. The person running the agent may be banned
from contributing and reported to GitHub.

Any conduct after a rejection is covered by SymPy's `Code of Conduct`_.
This includes operators of agents, not just human contributors. Trying to
publicly shame or pressure SymPy maintainers after a rejection — through
blog posts, social media, or anything outside this project — is a violation
of the Code of Conduct and may result in a permanent ban.

Code Quality
============

Code generated by AI is very often of low quality. Contributors are expected to
submit code that meets SymPy's standards. We will reject pull requests that we
deem being "`AI slop`_". Do not waste developers' time by submitting code that
is fully or mostly generated by AI.

Copyright
=========

All code in SymPy is released under the BSD 3-clause copyright license.
Contributors to SymPy license their code under the same license when it is
included into SymPy's version control repository. That means contributors must
own the copyright of any code submitted to SymPy or must include the BSD
3-clause compatible open source license(s) associated with the submitted code
in the patch. Code generated by AI may infringe on copyright and it is the
submitter's responsibility to not infringe. We will reject any pull requests,
AI generated or not, where the copyright is in question. 
When AI tools offer features to detect or avoid output that resembles publicly 
available code, contributors are encouraged to enable them.

Communication
=============

When interacting in communication among developers (email list, discussions,
issues, pull requests, etc.) do not use AI to speak for you, other than for
translation or grammar editing. If the developers want to chat with a chatbot,
they can do so themselves. Human-to-human communication is essential for an
open source community to thrive.

New Contributors
================

A high quality patch to SymPy that follows our development practices and
includes human communication to get it merged may be assisted by AI, but in our
experience, this requires a seasoned developer to properly execute. If you are
a new contributor to SymPy, we will most likely close any issues, discussions,
or pull requests that are substantially generated by AI. New contributors that
are applicants to programs such as Google Summer of Code that do not abide by
this AI policy and/or that use AI to produce their application will be
disqualified from the application process.
