Policy on AI Generated Code
===========================

All code in SymPy is released under the BSD 3-clause copyright license.
Contributors to SymPy license their code under the same license when it is
included into SymPy's version control repository. That means contributors must
own the copyright of any code submitted to SymPy or must include the BSD
3-clause compatible open source license(s) associated with the submitted code
in the patch. Code generated from large language models (or similar) may
infringe on copyright and it is the submitters responsibility to not infringe.
We will reject any pull requests where the copyright is in question.

Code generated from large language models (or similar) is very often of low
quality. Contributors are expected to contribute code that meets SymPy's
standards in the same manner as was expected before large language models
existed. We will reject pull requests that we deem as "AI slop". Please do not
waste developers' time by submitting code that is fully or mostly generated by
large language models (or similar).

A high quality patch to SymPy that follows our development practices and
includes human communication to get it merged may be assisted by large language
models and associated tools, but in our experience, this requires a seasoned
developer to properly execute. If you are new contributor to SymPy, we will
most likely close any issues, discussions, or pull requests that are generated
from large language models. Once again, please do not waste developers' time by
submitting AI generated code.

If you do make use of large language models (or similar) to assist in the
development of your patch, you must disclose how it was used and what code in
the patch is AI generated. We will reject any pull request that does not
include the disclosure.
