Polynomials Manipulation Module
===============================

Computations with polynomials are at the core of computer algebra and
having a fast and robust polynomials manipulation module is a key for
building a powerful symbolic manipulation system. SymPy has a dedicated
module :mod:`sympy.polys` for computing in polynomial algebras over
various coefficient domains.

There is a vast number of methods implemented, ranging from simple tools
like polynomial division, to advanced concepts including Gröbner bases
and multivariate factorization over algebraic number domains.
