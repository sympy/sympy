SymPy Mechanics for Autolev Users
=================================

Introduction
------------

Autolev (now superseded by MotionGenesis) is a domain specific programming
language which is used for symbolic multibody dynamics. The SymPy mechanics
module now has enough power and functionality to be a fully featured symbolic
dynamics module. The PyDy package extends the SymPy output to the numerical
domain for simulation, analyses and visualization. Autolev and SymPy Mechanics have
a lot in common but there are also many differences between them.
This page shall expand upon their differences. It is meant to be a go-to
reference for Autolev users who want to transition to SymPy Mechanics.

It would be nice to have a basic understanding of SymPy and SymPy Mechanics before
going over this page.
If you are completely new to Python, you can check out the official
`Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_.
Check out the :ref:`SymPy Documentation <documentation>`, especially
the tutorial to get a feel for SymPy.
For an introduction to Multibody dynamics in Python, `this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdo2NYtA-xY&t=6950s>`_
lecture is very helpful.

You might also find the :ref:`Autolev Parser <autolev_parser>` which is
a part of SymPy to be helpful.

Rough Autolev-SymPy Equivalents
----------------------------------

The tables below give rough equivalents for some common Autolev
expressions. **These are not exact equivalents**, but rather should be
taken as hints to get you going in the right direction. For more detail
read the built-in documentation on :ref:`SymPy vectors <physics_vector>`,
:ref:`SymPy mechanics <classical_mechanics>` and
`PyDy <https://www.pydy.org/documentation.html>`_ .

In the tables below, it is assumed that you have executed the following
commands in Python:
::

    import sympy.physics.mechanics as me
    import sympy as sm

Numerical Evaluation and Visualization
----------------------------------------

Autolev’s CODE Option() command allows one to generate Matlab, C, or
Fortran code for numerical evaluation and visualization. Option can be
Dynamics, ODE, Nonlinear or Algebraic.

Numerical evaluation for dynamics can be achieved using PyDy. One can
pass in the KanesMethod object to the System class along with the values
for the constants, specifieds, initial conditions and time steps. The
equations of motion can then be integrated. The plotting is achieved
using matlplotlib. Here is an example from the `PyDy Documentation <https://www.pydy.org/documentation.html>`_
on how it is done::

    from numpy import array, linspace, sin
    from pydy.system import System

    sys = System(kane,
                 constants = {mass: 1.0, stiffness: 1.0,
                              damping: 0.2, gravity: 9.8},
                 specifieds = {force: lambda x, t: sin(t)},
                 initial_conditions = {position: 0.1, speed:-1.0},
                 times = linspace(0.0, 10.0, 1000))

    y = sys.integrate()

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(sys.times, y)
    plt.legend((str(position), str(speed)))
    plt.show()

For information on all the things PyDy can accomplish refer to the
`PyDy Documentation <https://www.pydy.org/documentation.html>`_.

The tools in the PyDy workflow are :

-  `SymPy <https://sympy.org>`_: SymPy is a Python library for
    symbolic computation. It provides computer algebra capabilities
    either as a standalone application, as a library to other
    applications, or live on the web as SymPy Live or SymPy Gamma.

-  `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_: NumPy is a library for the
    Python programming language, adding support for large,
    multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large
    collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on
    these arrays.

-  `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_: SciPy is an open source
    Python library used for scientific computing and technical
    computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear
    algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT,
    signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common
    in science and engineering.

-  `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`_: IPython is a command shell
    for interactive computing in multiple programming languages,
    originally developed for the Python programming language, that
    offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion,
    and history.

-  `Aesara <https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_: Aesara is
    a numerical computation library for Python. In Aesara,
    computations are expressed using a NumPy-esque syntax and
    compiled to run efficiently on either CPU or GPU architectures.

-  `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_: Cython is a superset of the
    Python programming language, designed to give C-like performance
    with code that is mostly written in Python. Cython is a compiled
    language that generates CPython extension modules.

-  `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_: matplotlib is a
    plotting library for the Python programming language and its
    numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

One will be able to write code equivalent to the Matlab, C or Fortran
code generated by Autolev using these scientific computing tools. It is
recommended to go over these modules to gain an understanding of
scientific computing with Python.
