======

Mpmath is a Python library for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic.
It is used in SymPy for any calculation with floating-point numbers.
These pages documents mpmath's main features, with extensive use of examples
that can be run in the interactive Python interpreter.

The features shown apply for version 0.8 of mpmath. You can use it from SymPy
easily as::

    In [1]: from sympy.mpmath import mpf

    In [2]: mpf("5.5")
    Out[2]: mpf('5.5')
