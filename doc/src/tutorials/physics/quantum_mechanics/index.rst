Quantum Mechanics Tutorials 
=================================

These tutorials are prepared by Dr. Al Rey Villagracia to demonstrate on  how to use the :mod:`sympy.physics.quantum` module and related
symbolic tools for quantum mechanics. We cover examples such as defining operators,
computing commutators, and representing state vectors. Each example includes
step-by-step code and explanations that are helpful for both education and research.
