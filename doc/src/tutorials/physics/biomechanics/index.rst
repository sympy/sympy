These tutorials provide a comprehensive guide on using SymPy for
biomechanical simulations and analysis. We cover various models, including
a human arm moving a lever, forces produced by muscles, and
tendons using Hill-type muscle models.

In these tutorials, you can expect:

- Model description: Detailed explanation of each biomechanical model.

- Variables and Kinematics: Definition of necessary variables and kinematics equations essential for modeling.

- Modeling: Step-by-step process of constructing the biomechanical models.

- Equations of Motion: Derivation and analysis of the equations of motion for the systems.
