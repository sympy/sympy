Mechanics Tutorials
===================

These tutorials are designed to showcase the functionality of the :obj:`sympy.physics.mechanics` module through
detailed examples and step-by-step instructions. We demonstrate how to model various mechanical systems,
derive equations of motion, and solve dynamic problems using Kane's and Lagrange's method.
Each example includes clear explanations, mathematical formulations, and code to illustrate key concepts.
