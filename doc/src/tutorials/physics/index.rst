This tutorial aims to introduce SymPy to users who have not previously
used its physics features. The functionalities presented here have many
more options and capabilities than what is covered in this tutorial.
Through insightful examples and exercises, this tutorial demonstrates
how to incorporate various physics subpackages of SymPy, including but not limited to,
multibody dynamics, quantum mechanics, optics, and continuum mechanics, to model and simulate
different physical systems and their behaviors.

Feedback on this tutorial, or on SymPy in general is always welcome. Just
