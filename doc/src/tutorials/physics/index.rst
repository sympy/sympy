The Physics Tutorials aim to introduce SymPy to users who have not previously
used its physics features. The functionalities presented here have many
more options and capabilities than what is covered in the tutorials.
Through insightful examples and exercises, the tutorials demonstrate
how to incorporate various physics subpackages of SymPy, including but not limited to
multibody dynamics, quantum mechanics, optics, and continuum mechanics, to model and simulate
different physical systems and their behaviors.

Feedback on this tutorial, or on SymPy in general is always welcome. Just
write to our `mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sympy>`_.
