This tutorial aims to introduce SymPy to users who have not previously
used its physics features. The functionalities presented here have many
more options and capabilities than what is covered in this tutorial.
Through insightful examples and exercises, this tutorial demonstrates
how to incorporate the physics features of SymPy into a multibody dynamics model
and simulate the resulting equations of motion from the model.

Feedback on this tutorial, or on SymPy in general is always welcome. Just
write to our `mailing list
