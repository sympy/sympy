SymPy API Reference
====================

.. module:: sympy

This page has a detailed description of the SymPy API, categorized as ``public`` and
``private`` for public and private modules respectively. It discusses 
what the different functions and modules do, their arguments and return values.
For complete documentation including how to get started, 
see `documentation overview <https://docs.sympy.org>`_.

The public API documentation is further subdivided into eight categories for easy
navigation. The documentation for the public API is manually implemented using ``autoapi`` directives 
while those for the private API are auto generated.
