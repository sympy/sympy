def _forward_jacobian(
    expr: ImmutableDenseMatrix,
    wrt: ImmutableDenseMatrix,
):
    """Returns the Jacobian matrix produced using a forward accumulation
    algorithm.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Expressions often contain repeated subexpressions. If and expression is
    represented as a tree structure then multiple copies of these subexpressions
    will be present in the expanded form of the expression. During
    differentiation these repeated subexpressions will be repeatedly and
    differentiated multiple times, resulting in repeated and wasted work.

    Instead, if a data structure called a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is used
    then each of these repeated subexpressions will only exist a single time.
    This function uses a combination of representing the expression as a DAG and
    a forward accumulation algorithm (repeated application of the chain rule
    symbolically) to more efficiently calculate the Jacobian matrix of a target
    expression ``expr`` with respect to an expression or set of expressions
    ``wrt``.

    Note that this function is intended to improve performance when
    differentiating large expressions that contain many common subexpressions.
    For small and simple expressions it is likely less performant than using
    SymPy's standard differentiation functions and methods.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : ``ImmutableDenseMatrix``
        The vector to be differentiated.
    wrt : ``ImmutableDenseMatrix``
        The vector with respect to which to do the differentiation.
    as_cse_expr : ``bool``
        Influences the return type. If ``False``, then a matrix with fully-
        replaced SymPy expressions for entries will be returned. If ``True``,
        then the return type will be left as a ``CseExpr`` where the matrix's
        entries are reduced expressions containing replacements. The default is
        ``True``.
