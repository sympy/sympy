"""Module for Sympy containers

    (Sympy objects that store other Sympy objects)

    The containers implemented in this module are subclassed to Basic.
    They are supposed to work seamlessly within the Sympy framework.

    Wrapper around the builtin tuple object

    The Tuple is a subclass of Basic, so that it works well in the
    Sympy framework.  The wrapped tuple is available as self.args, but
    you can also access elements or slices with [:] syntax.

    Decorator that converts any tuple in the function arguments into a Tuple.

    The motivation for this is to provide simple user interfaces.  The user can
    call a function with regular tuples in the argument, and the wrapper will
    convert them to Tuples before handing them to the function.
