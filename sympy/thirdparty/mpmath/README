----------

* Version 0.4 released on November 3, 2007
* Version 0.3 released on October 5, 2007
* Version 0.2 released on October 2, 2007
* Version 0.1 released on September 27, 2007

For a detailed changelog, see the CHANGES file.


1. Download & installation
--------------------------

mpmath requires a recent version of Python. It has been tested with
Python 2.5 and should work with Python 2.4.

The latest release of mpmath can be downloaded from the mpmath
website. It should also be available in the Python Package Index at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi

To install, unpack the mpmath archive and run

  python setup.py install

The latest development code is available at
http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/


2. Documentation and usage
--------------------------

Note: some additional documentation is available on the mpmath website.
The unit tests and internal docstrings may also be helpful.

Import mpmath with

    from mpmath import *

This provides the classes mpf and mpc which work analogously to
Python's float and complex types:

    >>> mpf(2) / mpf(3)
    mpf('0.66666666666666663')

    >>> mpc(0, -1)
    mpc(real='0.0', imag='-1.0')

    >>> mpf(-0.6) ** mpf(-0.2)
    mpc(real='0.89603999408558288', imag='-0.65101116249684809')

For prettier output (that also hides small rounding errors), use
print or str():

    >>> print mpf(2) / mpf(3)
    0.666666666666667

    >>> print mpc(1+2j)**0.5
    (1.27201964951407 + 0.786151377757423j)

The precision is controlled by the properties mpf.prec (number of bits)
and mpf.dps (number of decimals). These properties are linked, so
changing one automatically updates the other to match. Setting prec or
dps changes the precision at which all operations are carried out and
the number of digits to display when printing numbers. The default is
prec=53 and dps=15, the same as Python floats.

    >>> mpf.dps = 30
    >>> mpf(2) / mpf(3)
    mpf('0.66666666666666666666666666666663')
    >>> print _
    0.666666666666666666666666666667
    >>> mpf.dps = 15     # restore to default

You can create mpfs and mpcs from Python numbers, or combine mpfs
and mpcs with Python numbers in arithmetic operations, but be
aware that regular Python floats only have finite precision. To
initialize an mpf with a full-precision value, use a string:

    >>> mpf(0.1)
    mpf('0.10000000000000001')      # same accuracy as float
    >>> mpf.dps = 50
    >>> mpf(0.1)
    mpf('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541016')   # junk

    >>> mpf('0.1')
    mpf('0.1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001')   # ok

The following standard functions are available and support both real and
complex arguments:

  sqrt, exp, log, power, cos, sin, tan, cosh, sinh, tanh,
  acos, asin, atan, acosh, asinh, atanh

Example:

    >>> mpf.dps = 15
    >>> print cos(1)
    0.540302305868140
    >>> mpf.dps = 50
    >>> print cos(1)
    0.54030230586813971740093660744297660373231042061792

Some less-common functions are also available: gamma (gamma function),
factorial, erf (error function), lower_gamma/upper_gamma (incomplete
gamma function) and zeta (Riemann zeta function).

Finally, the convenience functions hypot and atan2 are available
(defined for real numbers only).

The constants pi, e, and cgamma (Euler's constant) are available as
special objects that behave like mpfs but whose values automatically
adjust to the precision.

    >>> mpf.dps = 15
    >>> print pi
    3.14159265358979
    >>> mpf.dps = 50
    >>> print pi
    3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751

    >>> mpf.dps = 15
    >>> e**(-pi*1j)
    mpc(real='-1', imag='-1.2289836075083701E-16')
    >>> mpf.dps = 50
    >>> e**(-pi*1j)
    mpc(real='-1', imag='1.0106 [...] E-51')

Directed rounding is partially implemented. For example, this computes
and verifies a 15-digit approximation interval for pi:

    >>> mpf.dps = 15
    >>> mpf.round_down(); pi1 = +pi
    >>> mpf.round_up(); pi2 = +pi
    >>> pi1
    mpf('3.1415926535897931')
    >>> pi2
    mpf('3.1415926535897936')
    >>> mpf.dps = 30
    >>> pi1 < pi < pi2
    True


3. Known problems
-----------------

* mpmath temporarily increases the working precision during function
  evaluations to suppress the effects of intermediate rounding errors.
  In most functions, the precision is currently increased by a fixed amount
  that gives accurate results for "normal" input. Close to zeros and
  singularities, and/or with the precision set to (say) several hundred
  digits, the last few digits in a result may be wrong.

* Directed rounding works for arithmetic operations. It is implemented
  heuristically for other operations, and their results may be off by one
  or two bits in the last place (if otherwise accurate).

* Some IEEE 754 features such as infinities, NaN and denormal rounding
  are not supported
