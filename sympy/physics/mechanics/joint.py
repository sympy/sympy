class Joint(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all specific joints.

    Explanation
    ===========

    A joint subtracts degrees of freedom from a body. This is the base class
    for all specific joints and holds all common methods acting as an interface
    for all joints. Custom joint can be created by inheriting Joint class and
    defining all abstract functions.

    The abstract methods are:

    - ``_generate_coordinates``
    - ``_generate_speeds``
    - ``_orient_frames``
    - ``_set_angular_velocity``
    - ``_set_linear_velocity``

    Parameters
    ==========

    name : string
        A unique name for the joint.
    parent : Body
        The parent body of joint.
    child : Body
        The child body of joint.
    coordinates: iterable of dynamicsymbols, optional
        Generalized coordinates of the joint.
    speeds : iterable of dynamicsymbols, optional
        Generalized speeds of joint.
    parent_point : Point or Vector, optional
        Attachment point where the joint is fixed to the parent body. If a
        vector is provided, then the attachment point is computed by adding the
        vector to the body's mass center. The default value is the parent's mass
        center.
    child_point : Point or Vector, optional
        Attachment point where the joint is fixed to the child body. If a
        vector is provided, then the attachment point is computed by adding the
        vector to the body's mass center. The default value is the child's mass
        center.
    parent_axis : Vector, optional
        .. deprecated:: 1.12
            Axis fixed in the parent body which aligns with an axis fixed in the
            child body. The default is the x axis of parent's reference frame.
            For more information on this deprecation, see
            :ref:`deprecated-mechanics-joint-axis`.
    child_axis : Vector, optional
        .. deprecated:: 1.12
            Axis fixed in the child body which aligns with an axis fixed in the
            parent body. The default is the x axis of child's reference frame.
            For more information on this deprecation, see
            :ref:`deprecated-mechanics-joint-axis`.
    parent_interframe : ReferenceFrame, optional
        Intermediate frame of the parent body with respect to which the joint
        transformation is formulated. If a Vector is provided then an interframe
        is created which aligns its X axis with the given vector. The default
        value is the parent's own frame.
    child_interframe : ReferenceFrame, optional
        Intermediate frame of the child body with respect to which the joint
        transformation is formulated. If a Vector is provided then an interframe
        is created which aligns its X axis with the given vector. The default
        value is the child's own frame.
    parent_joint_pos : Point or Vector, optional
        .. deprecated:: 1.12
            This argument is replaced by parent_point and will be removed in a
            future version.
            See :ref:`deprecated-mechanics-joint-pos` for more information.
    child_joint_pos : Point or Vector, optional
        .. deprecated:: 1.12
            This argument is replaced by child_point and will be removed in a
            future version.
            See :ref:`deprecated-mechanics-joint-pos` for more information.

        Matrix of the joint's generalized speeds.
    parent_point : Point
        Attachment point where the joint is fixed to the parent body.
    child_point : Point
        Attachment point where the joint is fixed to the child body.
    parent_axis : Vector
        The axis fixed in the parent frame that represents the joint.
    child_axis : Vector
        The axis fixed in the child frame that represents the joint.
    parent_interframe : ReferenceFrame
        Intermediate frame of the parent body with respect to which the joint
        transformation is formulated.
    child_interframe : ReferenceFrame
        Intermediate frame of the child body with respect to which the joint
        transformation is formulated.
    kdes : Matrix
        Kinematical differential equations of the joint.

    Notes
    =====

    When providing a vector as the intermediate frame, a new intermediate frame
    is created which aligns its X axis with the provided vector. This is done
    with a single fixed rotation about a rotation axis. This rotation axis is
    determined by taking the cross product of the ``body.x`` axis with the
    provided vector. In the case where the provided vector is in the ``-body.x``
    direction, the rotation is done about the ``body.y`` axis.

        ==========

        frame: Body or ReferenceFrame
            The body or reference frame with respect to which the intermediate

            The vector with respect to which the intermediate frame will be

        frame_axis: Vector
            The vector of the frame which should get aligned with ``axis``. The
            default is the X axis of the frame.
        frame_name: string
            Name of the to be created intermediate frame. The default adds
            "_int_frame" to the name of ``frame``.

        Example
        =======

        An intermediate frame, where the X axis of the parent becomes aligned
        with ``parent.y + parent.z`` can be created as follows:

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics.joint import Joint
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body

        >>> parent_interframe = Joint._create_aligned_interframe(

        parent_int_frame
        >>> parent.dcm(parent_interframe)

        [        0, -sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2],
        [sqrt(2)/2,        1/2,       -1/2],
        [sqrt(2)/2,       -1/2,        1/2]])
        >>> (parent.y + parent.z).express(parent_interframe)
        sqrt(2)*parent_int_frame.x

        Notes
        =====

        The direction cosine matrix between the given frame and intermediate
        frame is formed using a simple rotation about an axis that is normal to
        both ``align_axis`` and ``frame_axis``. In general, the normal axis is
        formed by crossing the ``frame_axis`` with the ``align_axis``. The
        exception is if the axes are parallel with opposite directions, in which
        case the rotation vector is chosen using the rules in the following
        table with the vectors expressed in the given frame:

class PinJoint(Joint, _JointAxisMixin):

    .. image:: PinJoint.svg

    Explanation
    ===========

    A pin joint is defined such that the joint rotation axis is fixed in both
    the child and parent and the location of the joint is relative to the mass
    center of each body. The child rotates an angle, θ, from the parent about
    the rotation axis and has a simple angular speed, ω, relative to the
    parent. The direction cosine matrix between the child interframe and
    parent interframe is formed using a simple rotation about the joint axis.
    The page on the joints framework gives a more detailed explanation of the
    intermediate frames.

    Examples
    =========

    A single pin joint is created from two bodies and has the following basic
    attributes:

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body, PinJoint
    >>> parent = Body('P')
    >>> parent
    P
    >>> child = Body('C')
    >>> child
    C
    >>> joint = PinJoint('PC', parent, child)
    >>> joint
    PinJoint: PC  parent: P  child: C
    >>> joint.name
    'PC'
    >>> joint.parent
    P
    >>> joint.child
    C
    >>> joint.parent_point
    P_masscenter
    >>> joint.child_point
    C_masscenter
    >>> joint.parent_axis
    P_frame.x
    >>> joint.child_axis
    C_frame.x
    >>> joint.coordinates
    Matrix([[q_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.speeds
    Matrix([[u_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.child.frame.ang_vel_in(joint.parent.frame)
    u_PC(t)*P_frame.x
    >>> joint.child.frame.dcm(joint.parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1,             0,            0],
    [0,  cos(q_PC(t)), sin(q_PC(t))],
    [0, -sin(q_PC(t)), cos(q_PC(t))]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    0

    To further demonstrate the use of the pin joint, the kinematics of simple
    double pendulum that rotates about the Z axis of each connected body can be
    created as follows.

    >>> from sympy import symbols, trigsimp
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body, PinJoint
    >>> l1, l2 = symbols('l1 l2')

    First create bodies to represent the fixed ceiling and one to represent
    each pendulum bob.

    >>> ceiling = Body('C')
    >>> upper_bob = Body('U')
    >>> lower_bob = Body('L')

    The first joint will connect the upper bob to the ceiling by a distance of
    ``l1`` and the joint axis will be about the Z axis for each body.

    >>> ceiling_joint = PinJoint('P1', ceiling, upper_bob,
    ... child_point=-l1*upper_bob.frame.x,
    ... joint_axis=ceiling.frame.z)

    The second joint will connect the lower bob to the upper bob by a distance
    of ``l2`` and the joint axis will also be about the Z axis for each body.

    >>> pendulum_joint = PinJoint('P2', upper_bob, lower_bob,
    ... child_point=-l2*lower_bob.frame.x,
    ... joint_axis=upper_bob.frame.z)

    Once the joints are established the kinematics of the connected bodies can
    be accessed. First the direction cosine matrices of pendulum link relative
    to the ceiling are found:

    >>> upper_bob.frame.dcm(ceiling.frame)
    Matrix([
    [ cos(q_P1(t)), sin(q_P1(t)), 0],
    [-sin(q_P1(t)), cos(q_P1(t)), 0],
    [            0,            0, 1]])
    >>> trigsimp(lower_bob.frame.dcm(ceiling.frame))
    Matrix([
    [ cos(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), sin(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), 0],
    [-sin(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), cos(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), 0],
    [                      0,                      0, 1]])

    The position of the lower bob's masscenter is found with:

    >>> lower_bob.masscenter.pos_from(ceiling.masscenter)
    l1*U_frame.x + l2*L_frame.x

    The angular velocities of the two pendulum links can be computed with
    respect to the ceiling.

    >>> upper_bob.frame.ang_vel_in(ceiling.frame)
    u_P1(t)*C_frame.z
    >>> lower_bob.frame.ang_vel_in(ceiling.frame)
    u_P1(t)*C_frame.z + u_P2(t)*U_frame.z

    And finally, the linear velocities of the two pendulum bobs can be computed
    with respect to the ceiling.

    >>> upper_bob.masscenter.vel(ceiling.frame)
    l1*u_P1(t)*U_frame.y
    >>> lower_bob.masscenter.vel(ceiling.frame)
    l1*u_P1(t)*U_frame.y + l2*(u_P1(t) + u_P2(t))*L_frame.y

    Explanation
    ===========

    It is defined such that the child body translates with respect to the parent
    body along the body-fixed joint axis. The location of the joint is defined
    by two points, one in each body, which coincide when the generalized
    coordinate is zero. The direction cosine matrix between the
    parent_interframe and child_interframe is the identity matrix. Therefore,
    the direction cosine matrix between the parent and child frames is fully
    defined by the definition of the intermediate frames. The page on the joints

    [0, 0, 1]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    q_PC(t)*P_frame.x

    To further demonstrate the use of the prismatic joint, the kinematics of two
    masses sliding, one moving relative to a fixed body and the other relative
    to the moving body. about the X axis of each connected body can be created
    as follows.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import PrismaticJoint, Body

    First create bodies to represent the fixed ceiling and one to represent
    a particle.

    >>> wall = Body('W')
    >>> Part1 = Body('P1')
    >>> Part2 = Body('P2')

    The first joint will connect the particle to the ceiling and the
    joint axis will be about the X axis for each body.

    >>> J1 = PrismaticJoint('J1', wall, Part1)

    The second joint will connect the second particle to the first particle
    and the joint axis will also be about the X axis for each body.

    >>> J2 = PrismaticJoint('J2', Part1, Part2)

    Once the joint is established the kinematics of the connected bodies can
    be accessed. First the direction cosine matrices of Part relative
    to the ceiling are found:

    >>> Part1.dcm(wall)
    Matrix([
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]])

    >>> Part2.dcm(wall)
    Matrix([
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]])

    The position of the particles' masscenter is found with:

    >>> Part1.masscenter.pos_from(wall.masscenter)
    q_J1(t)*W_frame.x

    >>> Part2.masscenter.pos_from(wall.masscenter)
    q_J1(t)*W_frame.x + q_J2(t)*P1_frame.x

    The angular velocities of the two particle links can be computed with
    respect to the ceiling.

    >>> Part1.ang_vel_in(wall)
    0

    >>> Part2.ang_vel_in(wall)
    0

    And finally, the linear velocities of the two particles can be computed
    with respect to the ceiling.

    >>> Part1.masscenter_vel(wall)
    u_J1(t)*W_frame.x

    >>> Part2.masscenter.vel(wall.frame)

    Explanation
    ===========

    A cylindrical joint is defined such that the child body both rotates about
    and translates along the body-fixed joint axis with respect to the parent
    body. The joint axis is both the rotation axis and translation axis. The
    location of the joint is defined by two points, one in each body, which
    coincide when the generalized coordinate corresponding to the translation is
    zero. The direction cosine matrix between the child interframe and parent
    interframe is formed using a simple rotation about the joint axis. The page
    on the joints framework gives a more detailed explanation of the
    intermediate frames.

    Examples
    =========

    A single cylindrical joint is created between two bodies and has the
    following basic attributes:

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body, CylindricalJoint
    >>> parent = Body('P')
    >>> parent
    P
    >>> child = Body('C')
    >>> child
    C
    >>> joint = CylindricalJoint('PC', parent, child)
    >>> joint
    CylindricalJoint: PC  parent: P  child: C
    >>> joint.name
    'PC'
    >>> joint.parent
    P
    >>> joint.child
    C
    >>> joint.parent_point
    P_masscenter
    >>> joint.child_point
    C_masscenter
    >>> joint.parent_axis
    P_frame.x
    >>> joint.child_axis
    C_frame.x
    >>> joint.coordinates
    Matrix([
    [q0_PC(t)],
    [q1_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.speeds
    Matrix([
    [u0_PC(t)],
    [u1_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.child.frame.ang_vel_in(joint.parent.frame)
    u0_PC(t)*P_frame.x
    >>> joint.child.frame.dcm(joint.parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1,              0,             0],
    [0,  cos(q0_PC(t)), sin(q0_PC(t))],
    [0, -sin(q0_PC(t)), cos(q0_PC(t))]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    q1_PC(t)*P_frame.x
    >>> child.masscenter.vel(parent.frame)
    u1_PC(t)*P_frame.x

    To further demonstrate the use of the cylindrical joint, the kinematics of
    two cylindral joints perpendicular to each other can be created as follows.

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body, CylindricalJoint
    >>> r, l, w = symbols('r l w')

    First create bodies to represent the fixed floor with a fixed pole on it.
    The second body represents a freely moving tube around that pole. The third
    body represents a solid flag freely translating along and rotating around
    the Y axis of the tube.

    >>> floor = Body('floor')
    >>> tube = Body('tube')
    >>> flag = Body('flag')

    The first joint will connect the first tube to the floor with it translating
    along and rotating around the Z axis of both bodies.

    >>> floor_joint = CylindricalJoint('C1', floor, tube, joint_axis=floor.z)

    The second joint will connect the tube perpendicular to the flag along the Y
    axis of both the tube and the flag, with the joint located at a distance
    ``r`` from the tube's center of mass and a combination of the distances
    ``l`` and ``w`` from the flag's center of mass.

    >>> flag_joint = CylindricalJoint('C2', tube, flag,
    ...                               parent_point=r * tube.y,
    ...                               child_point=-w * flag.y + l * flag.z,
    ...                               joint_axis=tube.y)

    Once the joints are established the kinematics of the connected bodies can
    be accessed. First the direction cosine matrices of both the body and the
    flag relative to the floor are found:

    >>> tube.dcm(floor)
    Matrix([
    [ cos(q0_C1(t)), sin(q0_C1(t)), 0],
    [-sin(q0_C1(t)), cos(q0_C1(t)), 0],
    [             0,             0, 1]])
    >>> flag.dcm(floor)
    Matrix([
    [cos(q0_C1(t))*cos(q0_C2(t)), sin(q0_C1(t))*cos(q0_C2(t)), -sin(q0_C2(t))],
    [             -sin(q0_C1(t)),               cos(q0_C1(t)),              0],
    [sin(q0_C2(t))*cos(q0_C1(t)), sin(q0_C1(t))*sin(q0_C2(t)),  cos(q0_C2(t))]])

    The position of the flag's center of mass is found with:

    >>> flag.masscenter.pos_from(floor.masscenter)
    q1_C1(t)*floor_frame.z + (r + q1_C2(t))*tube_frame.y + w*flag_frame.y - l*flag_frame.z

    The angular velocities of the two tubes can be computed with respect to the
    floor.

    >>> tube.ang_vel_in(floor)
    u0_C1(t)*floor_frame.z
    >>> flag.ang_vel_in(floor)
    u0_C1(t)*floor_frame.z + u0_C2(t)*tube_frame.y

    Finally, the linear velocities of the two tube centers of mass can be
    computed with respect to the floor, while expressed in the tube's frame.

    >>> tube.masscenter.vel(floor.frame).to_matrix(tube.frame)
    Matrix([
    [       0],
    [       0],
    [u1_C1(t)]])
    >>> flag.masscenter.vel(floor.frame).to_matrix(tube.frame).simplify()
    Matrix([
    [-l*u0_C2(t)*cos(q0_C2(t)) - r*u0_C1(t) - w*u0_C1(t) - q1_C2(t)*u0_C1(t)],
    [                    -l*u0_C1(t)*sin(q0_C2(t)) + Derivative(q1_C2(t), t)],
    [                                    l*u0_C2(t)*sin(q0_C2(t)) + u1_C1(t)]])
