class LinearPathway(PathwayBase):
    """Linear pathway between a pair of attachment points.

    Explanation
    ===========

    A linear pathway forms a straight-line segment between two points and is
    the simplest pathway that can be formed. It will not interact with any
    other objects in the system, i.e. a ``LinearPathway`` will interest other
    objects to ensure that the path between its two ends (its attachments) is
    the shortest possible.

    Examples
    ========

    As the ``_pathway.py`` module is experimental, it is not yet part of the
    ``sympy.physics.mechanics`` namespace. ``LinearPathway`` must therefore be
    imported directly from the ``sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway`` module.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway

    To construct a pathway, two points are required to be passed to the
    ``attachments`` parameter as a ``tuple``.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point
    >>> pA, pB = Point('pA'), Point('pB')
    >>> linear_pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)
    >>> linear_pathway
    LinearPathway(pA, pB)

    The pathway created above isn't very interesting without the positions and
    velocities of its attachment points being described. Without this its not
    possible to describe how the pathway moves, i.e. its length or its
    shortening velocity.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import ReferenceFrame
    >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
    >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
    >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
    >>> pB.set_pos(pA, q * N.x)
    >>> pB.pos_from(pA)
    q(t)*N.x

    A pathway's length can be accessed via its ``length`` attribute.

    >>> linear_pathway.length
    sqrt(q(t)**2)

    Note how what appears to be an overly-complex expression is returned. This
    is actually required as it ensures that a pathway's length is always
    positive.

    A pathway's shortening velocity can be accessed similarly via its
    ``shortening_velocity`` attribute.

    >>> linear_pathway.shortening_velocity
    -q(t)*Derivative(q(t), t)/sqrt(q(t)**2)

    Parameters
    ==========

    attachments : tuple[Point, Point]
        The pair of ``Point`` objects between which the linear pathway spans.

    def compute_loads(self, force: Expr) -> list[tuple[Point, Vector]]:
        """Loads required by the equations of motion method classes.

        Explanation
        ===========

        ``KanesMethod`` requires a list of ``Point``-``Vector`` tuples to be
        passed to the ``loads`` parameters of its ``kanes_equations`` method
        when constructing the equations of motion. This method acts as a
        utility to produce the correctly-structred pairs of points and vectors
        required so that these can be easily concatenated with other items in
        the list of loads and passed to ``KanesMethod.kanes_equations``. These
        loads are also in the correct form to also be passed to the other
        equations of motion method classes, e.g. ``LagrangesMethod``.

        Examples
        ========

        The below example shows how to generate the loads produced in a linear
        actuator that produces a contractile force ``F``. First, create a
        linear actuator between two points separated by the coordinate ``q``
        in the ``x`` direction of the global frame ``N``.

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, ReferenceFrame
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway
        >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
        >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
        >>> pA, pB = Point('pA'), Point('pB')
        >>> pB.set_pos(pA, q * N.x)
        >>> linear_pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)

        Now create a symbol ``F`` to describe the magnitude of the
        (contractile) force that will be produced along the pathway. The list
        of loads that ``KanesMethod`` requires can be produced by calling the
        pathway's ``compute_loads`` method with ``F`` passed as the only
        argument.

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> F = Symbol('F')
        >>> linear_pathway.compute_loads(F)
        [(pA, F*q(t)/sqrt(q(t)**2)*N.x), (pB, - F*q(t)/sqrt(q(t)**2)*N.x)]

        Parameters
        ==========

        force : Expr
            The force acting along the length of the pathway. It is assumed
            that this ``Expr`` represents a contractile force.

        loads = [
