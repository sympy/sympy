        Explanation

        ``KanesMethod`` requires a list of ``Point``-``Vector`` tuples to be

        loads are also in the correct form to also be passed to the other
        equations of motion method classes, e.g. ``LagrangesMethod``.

        Examples
        ========

        The below example shows how to generate the loads produced by a force
        actuator that follows a linear pathway. In this example we'll assume
        that the force actuator is being used to model a simple linear spring.
        First, create a linear pathway between two points separated by the
        coordinate ``q`` in the ``x`` direction of the global frame ``N``.

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, ReferenceFrame
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway
        >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
        >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
        >>> pA, pB = Point('pA'), Point('pB')
        >>> pB.set_pos(pA, q * N.x)
        >>> pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)

        Now create a symbol ``k`` to describe the spring's stiffness and
        instantiate a force actuator that produces a (contractile) force
        proportional to both the spring's stiffness and the pathway's length.
        Note that actuator classes use the sign convention that expansile
        forces are positive, so for a spring to produce a contractile force the
        spring force needs to be calculated as the negative for the stiffness
        multiplied by the length.

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import ForceActuator
        >>> stiffness = Symbol('k')
        >>> spring_force = -stiffness * pathway.length
        >>> spring = ForceActuator(spring_force, pathway)

        The forces produced by the spring can be generated in the list of loads
        form that ``KanesMethod`` (and other equations of motion methods)
        requires by calling the ``to_loads`` method.

        >>> spring.to_loads()
        [(pA, k*q(t)*N.x), (pB, - k*q(t)*N.x)]

        A simple linear damper can be modeled in a similar way. Create another
        symbol ``c`` to describe the dampers damping coefficient. This time
        instantiate a force actuator that produces a force proportional to both
        the damper's damping coefficient and the pathway's extension velocity.
        Note that the damping force is negative as it acts in the opposite
        direction to which the damper is changing in length.

        >>> damping_coefficient = Symbol('c')
        >>> damping_force = -damping_coefficient * pathway.extension_velocity
        >>> damper = ForceActuator(damping_force, pathway)

        Again, the forces produces by the damper can be generated by calling
        the ``to_loads`` method.

        >>> damper.to_loads()
        [(pA, c*q(t)**2*Derivative(q(t), t)/q(t)**2*N.x),
         (pB, - c*q(t)**2*Derivative(q(t), t)/q(t)**2*N.x)]

class LinearSpring(ForceActuator):
    """A spring with its spring force as a linear function of its length.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Note that the "linear" in the name ``LinearSpring`` refers to the fact that
    the spring force is a linear function of the springs length. I.e. for a
    linear spring with stiffness ``k``, distance between its ends of ``x``, and
    an equilibrium length of ``0``, the spring force will be ``-k*x``, which is
    a linear function in ``x``. To create a spring that follows a linear, or
    straight, pathway between its two ends, a ``LinearPathway`` instance needs
    to be passed to the ``pathway`` parameter.

    Examples
    ========

    As the ``_actuator.py`` module is experimental, it is not yet part of the
    ``sympy.physics.mechanics`` namespace. ``LinearSpring`` must therefore be
    imported directly from the ``sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator`` module.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import LinearSpring

    This is similarly the case for imports from the ``_pathway.py`` module like
    ``LinearPathway``.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway

    To construct a linear spring, an expression (or symbol) must be supplied to
    represent the stiffness (spring constant) of the spring, alongside a
    pathway specifying its line of action. Let's also create a global reference
    frame and spatially fix one of the points in it while setting the other to
    be positioned such that it can freely move in the frame's x direction
    specified by the coordinate ``q``.

    >>> from sympy import Symbol
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, ReferenceFrame
    >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
    >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
    >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
    >>> stiffness = Symbol('k')
    >>> pA, pB = Point('pA'), Point('pB')
    >>> pA.set_vel(N, 0)
    >>> pB.set_pos(pA, q * N.x)
    >>> pB.pos_from(pA)
    q(t)*N.x
    >>> linear_pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)
    >>> spring = LinearSpring(stiffness, linear_pathway)
    >>> spring
    LinearSpring(k, LinearPathway(pA, pB))

    This spring will produce a force that is proportional to both its stiffness
    and the pathway's length. Note that this force is negative as SymPy's sign
    convention for actuators is that negative forces are contractile.

    >>> spring.force
    -k*sqrt(q(t)**2)

    To create a linear spring with a non-zero equilibrium length, an expression
    (or symbol) can be passed to the ``equilibrium_length`` parameter on
    construction on a ``LinearSpring`` instance. Let's create a symbol ``l``
    to denote a non-zero equilibrium length and create another linear spring.

    >>> l = Symbol('l')
    >>> spring = LinearSpring(stiffness, linear_pathway, equilibrium_length=l)
    >>> spring
    LinearSpring(k, LinearPathway(pA, pB), equilibrium_length=l)

    The spring force of this new spring is again proportional to both its
    stiffness and the pathway's length. However, the spring will not produce
    any force when ``q(t)`` equals ``l``. Note that the force will become
    expansile when ``q(t)`` is less than ``l``, as expected.

    >>> spring.force
    -k*(-l + sqrt(q(t)**2))

class LinearDamper(ForceActuator):
    """A damper whose force is a linear function of its extension velocity.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Note that the "linear" in the name ``LinearDamper`` refers to the fact that
    the damping force is a linear function of the damper's rate of change in
    its length. I.e. for a linear damper with damping ``c`` and extension
    velocity ``v``, the damping force will be ``-c*v``, which is a linear
    function in ``v``. To create a damper that follows a linear, or straight,
    pathway between its two ends, a ``LinearPathway`` instance needs to be
    passed to the ``pathway`` parameter.

    Examples
    ========

    As the ``_actuator.py`` module is experimental, it is not yet part of the
    ``sympy.physics.mechanics`` namespace. ``LinearDamper`` must therefore be
    imported directly from the ``sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator`` module.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import LinearDamper

    This is similarly the case for imports from the ``_pathway.py`` module like
    ``LinearPathway``.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway

    To construct a linear damper, an expression (or symbol) must be supplied to
    represent the damping coefficient of the damper (we'll use the symbol
    ``c``), alongside a pathway specifying its line of action. Let's also
    create a global reference frame and spatially fix one of the points in it
    while setting the other to be positioned such that it can freely move in
    the frame's x direction specified by the coordinate ``q``. The velocity
    that the two points move away from one another can be specified by the
    coordinate ``u`` where ``u`` is the first time derivative of ``q``
    (i.e., ``u = Derivative(q(t), t)``).

    >>> from sympy import Symbol
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, ReferenceFrame
    >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
    >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
    >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')

    >>> linear_pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)
    >>> damper = LinearDamper(damping, linear_pathway)
    >>> damper
    LinearDamper(c, LinearPathway(pA, pB))

    This damper will produce a force that is proportional to both its damping
    coefficient and the pathway's extension length. Note that this force is
    negative as SymPy's sign convention for actuators is that negative forces
    are contractile and the damping force of the damper will oppose the
    direction of length change.

    As the ``_actuator.py`` module is experimental, it is not yet part of the

        Examples
        ========

        To create a pin joint the ``PinJoint`` class requires a name, parent
        body, and child body to be passed to its constructor. It is also
        possible to control the joint axis using the ``joint_axis`` keyword
        argument. In this example let's use the parent body's reference frame's
        z-axis as the joint axis.

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import (PinJoint, ReferenceFrame,
        ... RigidBody)
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import TorqueActuator
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
        >>> A = ReferenceFrame('A')
        >>> parent = RigidBody('parent', frame=N)
        >>> child = RigidBody('child', frame=A)
        >>> pin_joint = PinJoint(
        ...     'pin',
        ...     parent,
        ...     child,
        ...     joint_axis=N.z,
        ... )

        Let's also create a symbol ``T`` that will represent the torque applied
        by the torque actuator.

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> torque = Symbol('T')

        To create the torque actuator from the ``torque`` and ``pin_joint``
        variables previously instantiated, these can be passed to the alternate
        constructor class method ``at_pin_joint`` of the ``TorqueActuator``
        class.

        >>> actuator = TorqueActuator.at_pin_joint(torque, pin_joint)

            joint, with the child acting as the reaction body. The pin joint's

        Explanation
        ===========

        ``KanesMethod`` requires a list of ``Point``-``Vector`` tuples to be
        passed to the ``loads`` parameters of its ``kanes_equations`` method
        when constructing the equations of motion. This method acts as a
        utility to produce the correctly-structred pairs of points and vectors
        required so that these can be easily concatenated with other items in
        the list of loads and passed to ``KanesMethod.kanes_equations``. These
        loads are also in the correct form to also be passed to the other
        equations of motion method classes, e.g. ``LagrangesMethod``.

        Examples
        ========

        The below example shows how to generate the loads produced by a torque
        actuator that acts on a pair of bodies attached by a pin joint.

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import (PinJoint, ReferenceFrame,
        ... RigidBody)
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import TorqueActuator
        >>> torque = Symbol('T')
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
        >>> A = ReferenceFrame('A')
        >>> parent = RigidBody('parent', frame=N)
        >>> child = RigidBody('child', frame=A)
        >>> pin_joint = PinJoint(
        ...     'pin',
        ...     parent,
        ...     child,
        ...     joint_axis=N.z,
        ... )
        >>> actuator = TorqueActuator.at_pin_joint(torque, pin_joint)

        The forces produces by the damper can be generated by calling the
        ``to_loads`` method.

        >>> actuator.to_loads()
        [(N, T*N.z), (A, - T*N.z)]

        Alternatively, if a torque actuator is created without a reaction frame
        then the loads returned by the ``to_loads`` method will contain just
        the single load acting on the target frame.

        >>> actuator = TorqueActuator(torque, N.z, N)
        >>> actuator.to_loads()
        [(N, T*N.z)]

        loads: list[LoadBase] = [
            Torque(self.target_frame, self.torque * self.axis),
        ]
        if self.reaction_frame is not None:
            loads.append(Torque(self.reaction_frame, -self.torque * self.axis))
        return loads
