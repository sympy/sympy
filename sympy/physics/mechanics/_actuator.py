        Explanation
        ===========

        ``KanesMethod`` requires a list of ``Point``-``Vector`` tuples to be
        passed to the ``loads`` parameters of its ``kanes_equations`` method
        when constructing the equations of motion. This method acts as a
        utility to produce the correctly-structred pairs of points and vectors
        required so that these can be easily concatenated with other items in
        the list of loads and passed to ``KanesMethod.kanes_equations``. These
        loads are also in the correct form to also be passed to the other
        equations of motion method classes, e.g. ``LagrangesMethod``.
