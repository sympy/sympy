class ForceActuator:

    Explanation
    ===========

    A ``ForceActuator`` is an actuator that produces a (contractile) force
    along its length.

    Examples
    ========

    As the ``_actuator.py`` module is experimental, it is not yet part of the
    ``sympy.physics.mechanics`` namespace. ``ForceActuator`` must therefore be
    imported directly from the ``sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator`` module.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import ForceActuator

    This is similarly the case for imports from the ``_pathway.py`` module like
    ``LinearPathway``.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway

    To construct an actuator, an expression (or symbol) must be supplied to
    represent the force it can produce, alongside a pathway specifying its line
    of action. Let's also create a global reference frame and spatially fix one
    of the points in it while setting the other to be positioned such that it
    can freely move in the frame's x direction specified by the coordinate
    ``q``.

    >>> from sympy import Symbol
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, ReferenceFrame
    >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
    >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
    >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
    >>> force = Symbol('F')
    >>> pA, pB = Point('pA'), Point('pB')
    >>> pA.set_vel(N, 0)
    >>> pB.set_pos(pA, q * N.x)
    >>> pB.pos_from(pA)
    q(t)*N.x
    >>> linear_pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)
    >>> actuator = ForceActuator(force, linear_pathway)
    >>> actuator
    ForceActuator(F, LinearPathway(pA, pB))

        ===========

        ``KanesMethod`` requires a list of ``Point``-``Vector`` tuples to be
        passed to the ``loads`` parameters of its ``kanes_equations`` method
        when constructing the equations of motion. This method acts as a

        loads are also in the correct form to also be passed to the other
        equations of motion method classes, e.g. ``LagrangesMethod``.

        Examples
        ========

        The below example shows how to generate the loads produced by a force
        actuator that follows a linear pathway. In this example we'll assume
        that the force actuator is being used to model a simple linear spring.
        First, create a linear pathway between two points separated by the
        coordinate ``q`` in the ``x`` direction of the global frame ``N``.

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, ReferenceFrame
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._pathway import LinearPathway
        >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
        >>> q = dynamicsymbols('q')
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
        >>> pA, pB = Point('pA'), Point('pB')
        >>> pB.set_pos(pA, q * N.x)
        >>> pathway = LinearPathway(pA, pB)

        Now create a symbol ``k`` to describe the spring's stiffness and
        instantiate a force actuator that produces a (contractile) force
        proportional to both the spring's stiffness and the pathway's length.

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics._actuator import ForceActuator
        >>> stiffness = Symbol('k')
        >>> spring_force = stiffness * pathway.length
        >>> spring = ForceActuator(spring_force, pathway)

        The forces produced by the spring can be generated in the list of loads
        form that ``KanesMethod`` (and other equations of motion methods)
        requires by calling the ``to_loads`` method.

        >>> spring.to_loads()
        [(pA, k*q(t)*N.x), (pB, - k*q(t)*N.x)]

        A simple linear damper can be modeled in a similar way. Create another
        symbol ``c`` to describe the dampers damping coefficient. This time
        instantiate a force actuator that produces a force proportional to both
        the damper's damping coefficient and the pathway's shortening velocity.
        Note that the damping force is negative as it acts in the opposite
        direction to which the damper is changing in length.

        >>> damping_coefficient = Symbol('c')
        >>> damping_force = -damping_coefficient * pathway.shortening_velocity
        >>> damper = ForceActuator(damping_force, pathway)

        Again, the forces produces by the damper can be generated by calling
        the ``to_loads`` method.

        >>> damper.to_loads()
        [(pA, c*q(t)**2*Derivative(q(t), t)/q(t)**2*N.x),
         (pB, - c*q(t)**2*Derivative(q(t), t)/q(t)**2*N.x)]

        return self.pathway.compute_loads(self.force)
