class RouthHurwitz(MutableDenseMatrix):
    r"""
    A class for creating a Routh-Hurwitz table from a given polynomial.
    It handles special cases with methods discussed in [1]_.

    Note: When at least a row of the table is zero,
    the property ``zero_row_case`` is set to True.

    Explanation
    ============

    In mathematics, the Routh-Hurwitz table is used to determine the number of
    roots of a polynomial that have positive or negative real parts.

    It's crucial in the control system theory because it can be used to
    retrieve necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of a linear
    time-invariant control system.

    Once the table is constructed, the stability of the system can be assessed
    by counting the number of sign changes in the first column.
    Each sign change corresponds to a root with a positive real part, whereas
    each preservation of sign corresponds to a root with a negative real part.

    There are two special cases to consider during the construction of the
    table:

    1.  First Column Zero Case:
        If a zero appears in the first column of a row (while the row is not
        entirely zero), the Extended Routh's Table is constructed [2]_ and every
        information of these rows is stored in  ``zero_col_infos``.

    2.  Full Row Zero Case:
        If an entire row becomes zero, we can substitute the row with the
        coefficients of the derivative of an auxiliary polynomial.
        The auxiliary polynomial is constructed using the row immediately
        above the zero row [3]_.
        For instance, consider the following example:

        .. math::
            \begin{matrix}3\\2\\1\end{matrix}\begin{bmatrix}b_3&b_1\\
            b_2&b_0\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}

        The auxiliary polynomial will be: :math:`a(s) = b_2 s^2 + b_0`
        The characteristic is that, if :math:`p(s)` is the polynomial we are
        analyzing, :math:`p(s)=a(s)\cdot other(s)` and
        the roots of :math:`a(s)` are symmetric about the origin in the
        s-plane, so when we
        fall in this case, we should note that there could be poles with only
        imaginary part or poles with negative and positive real parts.


    The table is constructed for a polynomial of the form
    :math:`p(s) = b_n s^n + b_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \ldots + b_1 s + b_0`
    and the table has :math:`n+1` rows and the following structure:

    .. math::
        \begin{bmatrix}b_n&b_{n-2}&b_{n-4}&\cdots\\
        b_{n-1}&b_{n-3}&b_{n-5}&\cdots\\ c_{1}&c_2&c_3&\cdots\\
            d_{1}&d_2&d_3&\cdots\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots\end{bmatrix}

    In this table, the elements in the subsequent rows are computed using the
    formulas:
    :math:`c_i = \frac{b_{n-1}\cdot b_{n-2i}-b_n\cdot b_{n-(2i+1)}}{b_{n-1}}`

    :math:`d_i = \frac{c_1 \cdot b_{n-(2i+1)}-b_{n-1}\cdot c_{i+1}}{c_1}`

    Parameters
    ==========

    polynomial : :py:class:`~.Expr`, :py:class:`~.Number`
        The polynomial whose Routh-Hurwitz table is to be created.
    var : :py:class:`~.Symbol`
        The symbol representing the variable in the polynomial.
    infinitesimal_element : None, :py:class:`~.Symbol`, optional
        The symbol representing the infinitesimal element for the first column
        zero case.
        If not provided, a default symbol ``epsilon`` will be used.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.control import RouthHurwitz
    >>> b1, b2, b3, b4 = symbols('b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4')
    >>> s = symbols("s")

    Here is a generic example of how to use the ``RouthHurwitz`` class:

    >>> p = b1*s**3 + b2*s**2 + b3*s + b4
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p, s)
    Matrix([
    [                     b_1, b_3],
    [                     b_2, b_4],
    [(-b_1*b_4 + b_2*b_3)/b_2,   0],
    [                     b_4,   0]])
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p, s)[:, 0]
    Matrix([
    [                     b_1],
    [                     b_2],
    [(-b_1*b_4 + b_2*b_3)/b_2],
    [                     b_4]])

    Here you can see how the table appears in the first column zero case:

    >>> p1 = s**4 + s**3 + 3*s**2 + 3*s + 3
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p1, s)
    Matrix([
    [ 1, 3, 3],
    [ 1, 3, 0],
    [-3, 3, 0],
    [ 4, 0, 0],
    [ 3, 0, 0]])
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p1, s).zero_col_infos
    [(2, 1)]
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p1, s).zero_row_case
    False

    Here you can see how the table appears in the full row zero case
    (poles with only imaginary part):

    >>> p2 = s**6 + 2*s**5 + 8*s**4 + 12*s**3 + 20*s**2 + 16*s + 16
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p2, s)
    Matrix([
    [  1,  8, 20, 16],
    [  2, 12, 16,  0],
    [  2, 12, 16,  0],
    [  8, 24,  0,  0],
    [  6, 16,  0,  0],
    [8/3,  0,  0,  0],
    [ 16,  0,  0,  0]])
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p2, s).zero_row_case
    True
    >>> RouthHurwitz(p2, s).auxiliary_polynomials
    [Poly(2*s**4 + 12*s**2 + 16, s, domain='ZZ')]
