<h1>Computing Integrals using Meijer G-Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#computing-integrals-using-meijer-g-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This text aims do describe in some detail the steps (and subtleties) involved
in using Meijer G-functions for computing definite and indefinite integrals.
We shall ignore proofs completely.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The algorithm to compute <span class="math">\(\int f(x) \mathrm{d}x\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(\int_0^\infty f(x) \mathrm{d}x\)</span> generally consists of three steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Rewrite the integrand using Meijer G-functions (one or sometimes two).</li>
<li>Apply an integration theorem, to get the answer (usually expressed as another
G-function).</li>
<li>Expand the result in named special functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step (3) is implemented in the function hyperexpand (q.v.). Steps (1) and (2)
are described below. Morever, G-functions are usually branched. Thus our treatment
of branched functions is described first.</p>
<p>Some other integrals (e.g. <span class="math">\(\int_{-\infty}^\infty\)</span>) can also be computed by first
recasting them into one of the above forms. There is a lot of choice involved
here, and the algorithm is heuristic at best.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="polar-numbers-and-branched-functions">
<h2>Polar Numbers and Branched Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#polar-numbers-and-branched-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both Meijer G-Functions and Hypergeometric functions are typically branched
(possible branchpoints being <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\pm 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>). This is not very important
when e.g. expanding a single hypergeometric function into named special functions,
since sorting out the branches can be left to the human user. However this
algorithm manipulates and transforms G-functions, and to do this correctly it needs
at least some crude understanding of the branchings involved.</p>
<p>To begin, we consider the set
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{S} = \{(r, \theta) : r &gt; 0, \theta \in \mathbb{R}\}\)</span>. We have a map
<span class="math">\(p: \mathcal{S}: \rightarrow \mathbb{C}-\{0\}, (r, \theta) \mapsto r e^{i \theta}\)</span>.
Decreeing this to be a local biholomorphism gives <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> both a topology
and a complex structure. This Riemann Surface is usually referred to as the
Riemann Surface of the logarithm, for the following reason:
We can define maps
<span class="math">\(\operatorname{Exp}: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}, (x + i y) \mapsto (\exp(x), y)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\operatorname{Log}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, (e^x, y) \mapsto x + iy\)</span>.
These can both be shown to be holomorphic, and are indeed mutual inverses.</p>
<p>We also sometimes formally attach a point &#8220;zero&#8221; (<span class="math">\(0\)</span>) to <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and denote the
resulting object <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_0\)</span>. Notably there is no complex structure
defined near <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. A fundamental system of neighbourhoods is given by
<span class="math">\(\{\operatorname{Exp}(z) : \Re(z) &lt; k\}\)</span>, which at least defines a topology. Elements of
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}_0\)</span> shall be called polar numbers.
We further define functions
<span class="math">\(\operatorname{Arg}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, (r, \theta) \mapsto \theta\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(|.|: \mathcal{S}_0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}, (r, \theta) \mapsto r\)</span>.
These have evident meaning and are both continuous everywhere.</p>
<p>Using these maps many operations can be extended from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>. We define <span class="math">\(\operatorname{Exp}(a) \operatorname{Exp}(b) = \operatorname{Exp}(a + b)\)</span> for <span class="math">\(a, b \in \mathbb{C}\)</span>,
also for <span class="math">\(a \in \mathcal{S}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> we define
<span class="math">\(a^b = \operatorname{Exp}(b \operatorname{Log}(a))\)</span>.
It can be checked easily that using these definitions, many algebraic properties
holding for positive reals (e.g. <span class="math">\((ab)^c = a^c b^c\)</span>) which hold in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>
only for some numbers (because of branch cuts) hold indeed for all polar numbers.</p>
<p>As one peculiarity it should be mentioned that addition of polar numbers is not
usually defined. However, formal sums of polar numbers can be used to express
branching behaviour. For example, consider the functions <span class="math">\(F(z) = \sqrt{1 + z}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(G(a, b) = \sqrt{a + b}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a, b, z\)</span> are polar numbers.
The general rule is that functions of a single polar variable are defined in
such a way that they are continuous on circles, and agree with the usual
definition for positive reals. Thus if <span class="math">\(S(z)\)</span> denotes the standard branch of
the square root function on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, we are forced to define</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}F(z) = \begin{cases}
 S(p(z)) &amp;: |z| &lt; 1 \\
 S(p(z)) &amp;: -\pi &lt; \operatorname{Arg}(z) + 4\pi n \le \pi \text{ for some } n \in \mathbb{Z} \\
 -S(p(z)) &amp;: \text{else}
\end{cases}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>(We are omitting <span class="math">\(|z| = 1\)</span> here, this does not matter for integration.)
Finally we define <span class="math">\(G(a, b) = \sqrt{a}F(b/a)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="representing-branched-functions-on-the-argand-plane">
<h2>Representing Branched Functions on the Argand Plane<a class="headerlink" href="#representing-branched-functions-on-the-argand-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(f: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{C}\)</span> is a holomorphic function. We wish to
define a function <span class="math">\(F\)</span> on (part of) the complex numbers <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> that
represents <span class="math">\(f\)</span> as closely as possible. This process is knows as &#8220;introducing
branch cuts&#8221;. In our situation, there is actually a canonical way of doing this
(which is adhered to in all of SymPy), as follows: Introduce the &#8220;cut complex
plane&#8221;
<span class="math">\(C = \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R}_{\le 0}\)</span>. Define a function
<span class="math">\(l: C \to \mathcal{S}\)</span> via <span class="math">\(re^{i\theta} \mapsto r \operatorname{Exp}(i\theta)\)</span>. Here <span class="math">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(-\pi &lt; \theta \le \pi\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(l\)</span> is holomorphic, and we define
<span class="math">\(G = f \circ l\)</span>. This called &#8220;lifting to the principal branch&#8221; throughout the
SymPy documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="table-lookups-and-inverse-mellin-transforms">
<h2>Table Lookups and Inverse Mellin Transforms<a class="headerlink" href="#table-lookups-and-inverse-mellin-transforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we are given an integrand <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> and are trying to rewrite it as a
single G-function. To do this, we first split <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> into the form <span class="math">\(x^s g(x)\)</span>
(where <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> is supposed to be simpler than <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>). This is because multiplicative
powers can be absorbed into the G-function later. This splitting is done by
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_split_mul(f,</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></tt>. Then we assemble a tuple of functions that occur in
<span class="math">\(f\)</span> (e.g. if <span class="math">\(f(x) = e^x \cos{x}\)</span>, we would assemble the tuple <span class="math">\((\cos, \exp)\)</span>).
This is done by the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_mytype(f,</span> <span class="pre">x)</span></tt>. Next we index a lookup table
(created using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_create_lookup_table()</span></tt>) with this tuple. This (hopefully)
yields a list of Meijer G-function formulae involving these functions, we then
pattern-match all of them. If one fits, we were successful, otherwise not and we
have to try something else.</p>
<p>Suppose now we want to rewrite as a product of two G-functions. To do this,
we (try to) find all inequivalent ways of splitting <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> into a product
<span class="math">\(f_1(x) f_2(x)\)</span>.
We could try these splittings in any order, but it is often a good idea to
minimise (a) the number of powers occuring in <span class="math">\(f_i(x)\)</span> and (b) the number of
different functions occuring in <span class="math">\(f_i(x)\)</span>. Thus given e.g.
<span class="math">\(f(x) = \sin{x}\, e^{x} \sin{2x}\)</span> we should try <span class="math">\(f_1(x) = \sin{x}\, \sin{2x}\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(f_2(x) = e^{x}\)</span> first.
All of this is done by the function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_mul_as_two_parts(f)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can try a recursive Mellin transform technique. Since the Meijer
G-function is defined essentially as a certain inverse mellin transform,
if we want to write a function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> as a G-function, we can compute its mellin
transform <span class="math">\(F(s)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(F(s)\)</span> is in the right form, the G-function expression
can be read off. This technique generalises many standard rewritings, e.g.
<span class="math">\(e^{ax} e^{bx} = e^{(a + b) x}\)</span>.</p>
<p>One twist is that some functions don&#8217;t have mellin transforms, even though they
can be written as G-functions. This is true for example for <span class="math">\(f(x) = e^x \sin{x}\)</span>
(the function grows too rapidly to have a mellin transform). However if the function
is recognised to be analytic, then we can try to compute the mellin-transform of
<span class="math">\(f(ax)\)</span> for a parameter <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and deduce the G-function expression by analytic
continuation. (Checking for analyticity is easy. Since we can only deal with a
certain subset of functions anyway, we only have to filter out those which are
not analyitc.)</p>
<p>The function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_rewrite_single</span></tt> does the table lookup and recursive mellin
transform. The functions <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_rewrite1</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_rewrite2</span></tt> respectively use
above-mentioned helpers and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_rewrite_single</span></tt> to rewrite their argument as
respectively one or two G-functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applying-the-integral-theorems">
<h2>Applying the Integral Theorems<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-the-integral-theorems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the integrand has been recast into G-functions, evaluating the integral is
relatively easy. We first do some substitutions to reduce e.g. the exponent
of the argument of the G-function to unity (see <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_rewrite_saxena_1</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_rewrite_saxena</span></tt>, respectively, for one or two G-functions). Next we go through
a list of conditions under which the integral theorem applies. It can fail for
basically two reasons: either the integral does not exist, or the manipulations
in deriving the theorem may not be allowed (for more details, see this <a class="reference internal" href="#blogpost">[BlogPost]</a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be remedied by reducing the argument of the G-functions
involved. For example it is clear that the G-function representing <span class="math">\(e^z\)</span>
is satisfies <span class="math">\(G(\operatorname{Exp}(2 \pi i)z) = G(z)\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(z \in \mathcal{S}\)</span>. The function
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meijerg.get_period()</span></tt> can be used to discover this, and the function
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">principal_branch(z,</span> <span class="pre">period)</span></tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">functions/elementary/complexes.py</span></tt> can
be used to exploit the information. This is done transparently by the
integration code.</p>

proved more general formulae; indeed in the literature formulae are usually
staded in more general form. However it is very easy to deduce the general
formulae from the ones we give here. It seemed best to keep the theorems as
simple as possible, since they are very complicated anyway.):</p>

<h2>Conditions of Convergence for Integral (1)<a class="headerlink" href="#conditions-of-convergence-for-integral-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can without loss of generality assume <span class="math">\(p \le q\)</span>, since the G-functions
of indices <span class="math">\(m, n, p, q\)</span> and of indices <span class="math">\(n, m, q, p\)</span> can be related easily
(see e.g. <a class="reference internal" href="../simplify/hyperexpand.html#luke1969">[Luke1969]</a>, section 5.3). We introduce the following notation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\xi = m + n - p \\
\delta = m + n - \frac{p + q}{2}\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}C_3: -\Re(b_j) &lt; 1 \text{ for } j=1, \dots, m \\

<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}C_4: -\Re(\delta) + \frac{q + 1 - p}{2} &gt; q - p\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The convergence conditions will be detailed in several &#8220;cases&#8221;, numbered one
to five. For later use it will be helpful to separate conditions &#8220;at infinity&#8221;
from conditions &#8220;at zero&#8221;. By conditions &#8220;at infinity&#8221; we mean conditions that
only depend on the behaviour of the integrand for large, positive values
of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, whereas by conditions &#8220;at zero&#8221; we mean conditions that only depend on
the behaviour of the integrand on <span class="math">\((0, \epsilon)\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>.
Since all our conditions are specified in terms of parameters of the
G-functions, this distinction is not immediately visible. They are, however, of
very distinct character mathematically; the conditions at infinity being in
particular much harder to control.</p>
<p>In order for the integral theorem to be valid, conditions
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> &#8220;at zero&#8221; and &#8220;at infinity&#8221; both have to be fulfilled, for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>

<h1>The Inverse Laplace Transform of a G-function<a class="headerlink" href="#the-inverse-laplace-transform-of-a-g-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The inverse laplace transform of a Meijer G-function can be expressed as
another G-function. This is a fairly versatile method for computing this
transform. However, I could not find the details in the literature, so I work
them out here. In <a class="reference internal" href="../simplify/hyperexpand.html#luke1969">[Luke1969]</a>, section 5.6.3, there is a formula for the inverse
Laplace transform of a G-function of argument <span class="math">\(bz\)</span>, and convergence conditions
are also given. However, we need a formula for argument <span class="math">\(bz^a\)</span> for rational <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>We are asked to compute</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} e^{zt} G(bz^a) \mathrm{d}z,\]</div>
<p>for positive real <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. Three questions arise:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When does this integral converge?</li>
<li>How can we compute the integral?</li>
<li>When is our computation valid?</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="how-to-compute-the-integral">
<h2>How to compute the integral<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-compute-the-integral" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We shall work formally for now. Denote by <span class="math">\(\Delta(s)\)</span> the product of gamma
functions appearing in the definition of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, so that</p>
<div class="math">
\[G(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_L \Delta(s) z^s \mathrm{d}s.\]</div>
<p>Thus</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(t) = \frac{1}{(2\pi i)^2} \int_{c - i\infty}^{c + i\infty} \int_L
              e^{zt} \Delta(s) b^s z^{as} \mathrm{d}s \mathrm{d}z.\]</div>
<p>We interchange the order of integration to get</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_L b^s \Delta(s)
      \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} e^{zt} z^{as} \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{2\pi i}
            \mathrm{d}s.\]</div>
<p>The inner integral is easily seen to be
<span class="math">\(\frac{1}{\Gamma(-as)} \frac{1}{t^{1+as}}\)</span>. (Using Cauchy&#8217;s theorem and Jordan&#8217;s
lemma deform the contour to run from <span class="math">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math">\(-\infty\)</span>, encircling <span class="math">\(0\)</span> once
in the negative sense. For <span class="math">\(as\)</span> real and greater than one,
this contour can be pushed onto
the negative real axis and the integral is recognised as a product of a sine and
a gamma function. The formula is then proved using the functional equation of the
gamma function, and extended to the entire domain of convergence of the original
integral by appealing to analytic continuation.)
Hence we find</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(t) = \frac{1}{t} \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_L \Delta(s) \frac{1}{\Gamma(-as)}
              \left(\frac{b}{t^a}\right)^s \mathrm{d}s,\]</div>
<p>which is a so-called Fox H function (of argument <span class="math">\(\frac{b}{t^a}\)</span>). For rational
<span class="math">\(a\)</span>, this can be expressed as a Meijer G-function using the gamma function

<h2>When this computation is valid<a class="headerlink" href="#when-this-computation-is-valid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of obstacles in this computation. Interchange of integrals
is only valid if all integrals involved are absolutely convergent. In
particular the inner integral has to converge. Also, for our identification of
the final integral as a Fox H / Meijer G-function to be correct, the poles of
the newly obtained gamma function must be separated properly.</p>
<p>It is easy to check that the inner integal converges absolutely for
<span class="math">\(\Re(as) &lt; -1\)</span>. Thus the contour <span class="math">\(L\)</span> has to run left of the line <span class="math">\(\Re(as) = -1\)</span>.
Under this condition, the poles of the newly-introduced gamma function are
separated properly.</p>
<p>It remains to observe that the Meijer G-function is an analytic, unbranched
function of its parameters, and of the coefficient <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. Hence so is <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span>.
Thus the final computation remains valid as long as the initial integral
converges, and if there exists a changed set of parameters where the computation
is valid. If we assume w.l.o.g. that <span class="math">\(a &gt; 0\)</span>, then the latter condition is
fulfilled if <span class="math">\(G\)</span> converges along contours (2) or (3) of <a class="reference internal" href="../simplify/hyperexpand.html#luke1969">[Luke1969]</a>,
section 5.2, i.e. either <span class="math">\(\delta &gt;= \frac{a}{2}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(p \ge 1, p \ge q\)</span>.</p>

<h2>When the integral exists<a class="headerlink" href="#when-the-integral-exists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using <a class="reference internal" href="../simplify/hyperexpand.html#luke1969">[Luke1969]</a>, section 5.10, for any given meijer G-function we can find a
dominant term of the form <span class="math">\(z^a e^{bz^c}\)</span> (although this expression might not be
the best possible, because of cancellation).</p>
<p>We must thus investigate</p>
<div class="math">
\[\lim_{T \to \infty} \int_{c-iT}^{c+iT}
e^{zt} z^a e^{bz^c} \mathrm{d}z.\]</div>
<p>(This principal value integral is the exact statement used in the Laplace
inversion theorem.) We write <span class="math">\(z = c + i \tau\)</span>. Then
<span class="math">\(arg(z) \to \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>, and so <span class="math">\(e^{zt} \sim e^{it \tau}\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(\sim\)</span>
shall always mean &#8220;asymptotically equivalent up to a positive real
multiplicative constant&#8221;). Also
<span class="math">\(z^{x + iy} \sim |\tau|^x e^{i y \log{|\tau|}} e^{\pm x i \frac{\pi}{2}}.\)</span></p>
<p>Set <span class="math">\(\omega_{\pm} = b e^{\pm i \Re(c) \frac{\pi}{2}}\)</span>. We have three cases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="math">\(b=0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\Re(c) \le 0\)</span>.
In this case the integral converges if <span class="math">\(\Re(a) \le -1\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(b \ne 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Im(c) = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Re(c) &gt; 0\)</span>.
In this case the integral converges if <span class="math">\(\Re(\omega_{\pm}) &lt; 0\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(b \ne 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Im(c) = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Re(c) &gt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Re(\omega_{\pm}) \le 0\)</span>, and at least
one of <span class="math">\(\Re(\omega_{\pm}) = 0\)</span>.
Here the same condition as in (1) applies.</li>

<p>An important part of the algorithm is a table expressing various functions
as Meijer G-functions. This is essentially a table of Mellin Transforms in
disguise. The following automatically generated table shows the formulae
currently implemented in SymPy. An entry &#8220;generated&#8221; means that the
corresponding G-function has a variable number of parameters.
This table is intended to shrink in future, when the algorithm&#8217;s capabilities
of deriving new formulae improve. Of course it has to grow whenever a new class
of special functions is to be dealt with.</p>
