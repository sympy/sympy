#### Release Notes

<!-- Write the release notes for this release below between the BEGIN and END
statements. The basic format is a bulleted list with the name of the subpackage
and the release note for this PR. For example:

* solvers
  * Added a new solver for logarithmic equations.

* functions
  * Fixed a bug with log of integers. Formerly, `log(-x)` incorrectly gave `-log(x)`.

* physics.units
  * Corrected a semantical error in the conversion between volt and statvolt which
    reported the volt as being larger than the statvolt.

or if no release note(s) should be included use:

NO ENTRY
